<meta name="description" content="This paper underscores the vital role of the chi-square test within political science research utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM). The ongoing debate regarding the inclusion of chi-square test statistics alongside fit indices in result presentations has sparked controversy. Despite the recognized limitations of relying solely on the chi-square test, its judicious application can enhance its effectiveness in evaluating model fit and specification. To exemplify this, we present three common scenarios pertinent to political science research where fit indices may inadequately address goodness-of-fit concerns, while the chi-square statistic can be effectively harnessed. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we examine strategies for enhancing chi-square tests within these scenarios, showcasing the potential of appropriately employed chi-square tests to provide a comprehensive model fit assessment. Our recommendation is to report both the chi-square test and fit indices, with a priority on precise model specification to ensure the trustworthiness of model fit indicators." />

  <p>This paper underscores the vital role of the chi-square test within political science research utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM). The ongoing debate regarding the inclusion of chi-square test statistics alongside fit indices in result presentations has sparked controversy. Despite the recognized limitations of relying solely on the chi-square test, its judicious application can enhance its effectiveness in evaluating model fit and specification. To exemplify this, we present three common scenarios pertinent to political science research where fit indices may inadequately address goodness-of-fit concerns, while the chi-square statistic can be effectively harnessed. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we examine strategies for enhancing chi-square tests within these scenarios, showcasing the potential of appropriately employed chi-square tests to provide a comprehensive model fit assessment. Our recommendation is to report both the chi-square test and fit indices, with a priority on precise model specification to ensure the trustworthiness of model fit indicators.</p>
