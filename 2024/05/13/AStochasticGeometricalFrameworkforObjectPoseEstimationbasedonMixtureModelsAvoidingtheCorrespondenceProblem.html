  <h1>A Stochastic-Geometrical Framework for Object Pose Estimation based on Mixture Models Avoiding the Correspondence Problem</h1>

  <br> [stat.AP]

  <p>Background: Pose estimation of rigid objects is a practical challenge in optical metrology and computer vision. This paper presents a novel stochastic-geometrical modeling framework for object pose estimation based on observing multiple feature points.
  Methods: This framework utilizes mixture models for feature point densities in object space and for interpreting real measurements. Advantages are the avoidance to resolve individual feature correspondences and to incorporate correct stochastic dependencies in multi-view applications. First, the general modeling framework is presented, second, a general algorithm for pose estimation is derived, and third, two example models (camera and lateration setup) are presented.
  Results: Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of this modeling and general algorithm by presenting four simulation scenarios for three observation systems, including the dependence on measurement resolution, object deformations and measurement noise. Probabilistic modeling utilizing mixture models shows the potential for accurate and robust pose estimations while avoiding the correspondence problem.</p>
