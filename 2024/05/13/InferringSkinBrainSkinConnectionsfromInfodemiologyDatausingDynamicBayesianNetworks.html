  <p>The relationship between skin diseases and mental illnesses has been extensively studied using cross-sectional epidemiological data. Typically, such data can only measure association (rather than causation) and include only a subset of the diseases we may be interested in. In this paper, we complement the evidence from such analyses by learning an overarching causal network model over twelve health conditions from the Google Search Trends Symptoms public data set.
  We learned the causal network model using a dynamic Bayesian network, which can represent both cyclic and acyclic causal relationships, is easy to interpret and accounts for the spatio-temporal trends in the data in a probabilistically rigorous way. The causal network confirms a large number of cyclic relationships between the selected health conditions and the interplay between skin and mental diseases. For acne, we observe a cyclic relationship with anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and an indirect relationship with depression through sleep disorders. For dermatitis, we observe directed links to anxiety, depression and sleep disorders and a cyclic relationship with ADHD. We also observe a link between dermatitis and ADHD and a cyclic relationship between acne and ADHD. Furthermore, the network includes several direct connections between sleep disorders and other health conditions, highlighting the impact of the former on the overall health and well-being of the patient.
  Mapping disease interplay, indirect relationships, and the key role of mediators, such as sleep disorders, will allow healthcare professionals to address disease management holistically and more effectively. Even if we consider all skin and mental diseases jointly, each disease subnetwork is unique, allowing for more targeted interventions.</p>
