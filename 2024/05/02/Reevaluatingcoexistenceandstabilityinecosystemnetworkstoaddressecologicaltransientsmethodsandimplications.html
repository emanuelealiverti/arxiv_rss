<meta name="description" content="Representing ecosystems at equilibrium has been foundational for building ecological theories, forecasting species populations and planning conservation actions. The equilibrium “balance of nature” ideal suggests that populations will eventually stabilise to a coexisting balance of species.

Here, we develop and demonstrate a new framework for representing ecosystems without considering equilibrium dynamics. Instead, far more pragmatic ecosystem models are constructed by considering population trajectories, regardless of whether they exhibit equilibrium or transient (i.e. non-equilibrium) behaviour. This novel framework maximally utilises readily available, but often overlooked, knowledge from field observations and expert elicitation, rather than relying on theoretical ecosystem properties.

  <p>Representing ecosystems at equilibrium has been foundational for building ecological theories, forecasting species populations and planning conservation actions. The equilibrium “balance of nature” ideal suggests that populations will eventually stabilise to a coexisting balance of species. However, a growing body of literature argues that the equilibrium ideal is inappropriate for ecosystems. Here, we develop and demonstrate a new framework for representing ecosystems without considering equilibrium dynamics. Instead, far more pragmatic ecosystem models are constructed by considering population trajectories, regardless of whether they exhibit equilibrium or transient (i.e. non-equilibrium) behaviour. This novel framework maximally utilises readily available, but often overlooked, knowledge from field observations and expert elicitation, rather than relying on theoretical ecosystem properties. We developed innovative Bayesian algorithms to generate ecosystem models in this new statistical framework, without excessive computational burden. Our results reveal that our pragmatic framework could have a dramatic impact on conservation decision-making and enhance the realism of ecosystem models and forecasts.</p>
