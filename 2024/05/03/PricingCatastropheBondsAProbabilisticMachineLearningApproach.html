  <p>This paper proposes a probabilistic machine learning method to price catastrophe (CAT) bonds in the primary market. The proposed method combines machine-learning-based predictive models with Conformal Prediction, an innovative algorithm that generates distribution-free probabilistic forecasts for CAT bond prices. Using primary market CAT bond transaction records between January 1999 and March 2021, the proposed method is found to be more robust and yields more accurate predictions of the bond spreads than traditional regression-based methods. Furthermore, the proposed method generates more informative prediction intervals than linear regression and identifies important nonlinear relationships between various risk factors and bond spreads, suggesting that linear regressions could misestimate the bond spreads. Overall, this paper demonstrates the potential of machine learning methods in improving the pricing of CAT bonds.</p>
