  <p>The Pareto front of a set of vectors is the subset which is comprised solely of all of the best trade-off points. By interpolating this subset, we obtain the optimal trade-off surface. In this work, we prove a very useful result which states that all Pareto front surfaces can be explicitly parametrised using polar coordinates. In particular, our polar parametrisation result tells us that we can fully characterise any Pareto front surface using the length function, which is a scalar-valued function that returns the projected length along any positive radial direction. Consequently, by exploiting this representation, we show how it is possible to generalise many useful concepts from linear algebra, probability and statistics, and decision theory to function over the space of Pareto front surfaces. Notably, we focus our attention on the stochastic setting where the Pareto front surface itself is a stochastic process. Among other things, we showcase how it is possible to define and estimate many statistical quantities of interest such as the expectation, covariance and quantile of any Pareto front surface distribution. As a motivating example, we investigate how these statistics can be used within a design of experiments setting, where the goal is to both infer and use the Pareto front surface distribution in order to make effective decisions. Besides this, we also illustrate how these Pareto front ideas can be used within the context of extreme value theory. Finally, as a numerical example, we applied some of our new methodology on a real-world air pollution data set.</p>
