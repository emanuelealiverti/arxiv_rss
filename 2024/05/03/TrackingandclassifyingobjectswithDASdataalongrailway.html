  <p>Distributed acoustic sensing through fiber-optical cables can contribute to traffic monitoring systems. Using data from a day of field testing on a 50 km long fiber-optic cable along a railroad track in Norway, we detect and track cars and trains along a segment of the fiber-optic cable where the road runs parallel to the railroad tracks. We develop a method for automatic detection of events and then use these in a Kalman filter variant known as joint probabilistic data association for object tracking and classification. Model parameters are specified using in-situ log data along with the fiber-optic signals. Running the algorithm over an entire day, we highlight results of counting cars and trains over time and their estimated velocities.</p>
