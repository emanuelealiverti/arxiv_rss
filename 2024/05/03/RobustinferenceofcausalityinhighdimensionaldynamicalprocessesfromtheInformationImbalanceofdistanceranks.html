<meta name="description" content="We introduce an approach which allows detecting causal relationships between variables for which the time evolution is available. Causality is assessed by a variational scheme based on the Information Imbalance of distance ranks, a statistical test capable of inferring the relative information content of different distance measures. We test whether the predictability of a putative driven system Y can be improved by incorporating information from a potential driver system X, without explicitly modeling the underlying dynamics and without the need to compute probability densities of the dynamic variables. This framework makes causality detection possible even between high-dimensional systems where only few of the variables are known or measured. Benchmark tests on coupled chaotic dynamical systems demonstrate that our approach outperforms other model-free causality detection methods, successfully handling both unidirectional and bidirectional couplings.

  <p>We introduce an approach which allows detecting causal relationships between variables for which the time evolution is available. Causality is assessed by a variational scheme based on the Information Imbalance of distance ranks, a statistical test capable of inferring the relative information content of different distance measures. We test whether the predictability of a putative driven system Y can be improved by incorporating information from a potential driver system X, without explicitly modeling the underlying dynamics and without the need to compute probability densities of the dynamic variables. This framework makes causality detection possible even between high-dimensional systems where only few of the variables are known or measured. Benchmark tests on coupled chaotic dynamical systems demonstrate that our approach outperforms other model-free causality detection methods, successfully handling both unidirectional and bidirectional couplings. We also show that the method can be used to robustly detect causality in human electroencephalography data.</p>
