  <p>This paper presents a novel mathematical framework based on stochastic geometry to investigate the electromagnetic field exposure of idle and active users in cellular networks implementing dynamic beamforming. Accurate modeling of antenna gain becomes crucial in this context, encompassing both the main and the side lobes. The marginal distribution of EMF exposure for each type of users is initially derived. Subsequently, network performance is scrutinized by introducing a new metric aimed at ensuring minimal downlink coverage while simultaneously maintaining EMF exposure below distinct thresholds for both idle and active users. The metrics exhibit a high dependency on various parameters, such as the distance between active and idle users and the number of antenna elements.</p>
