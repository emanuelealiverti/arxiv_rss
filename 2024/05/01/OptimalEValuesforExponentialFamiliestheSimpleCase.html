<meta name="description" content="We provide a general condition under which e-variables in the form of a simple-vs.-simple likelihood ratio exist when the null hypothesis is a composite, multivariate exponential family. Such `simple’ e-variables are easy to compute and expected-log-optimal with respect to any stopping time. Simple e-variables were previously only known to exist in quite specific settings, but we offer a unifying theorem on their existence for testing exponential families. We start with a simple alternative $Q$ and a regular exponential family null. Together these induce a second exponential family ${\cal Q}$ containing $Q$, with the same sufficient statistic as the null. Our theorem shows that simple e-variables exist whenever the covariance matrices of ${\cal Q}$ and the null are in a certain relation. Examples in which this relation holds include some $k$-sample tests, Gaussian location- and scale tests, and tests for more general classes of natural exponential families." />

  <p>We provide a general condition under which e-variables in the form of a simple-vs.-simple likelihood ratio exist when the null hypothesis is a composite, multivariate exponential family. Such `simple’ e-variables are easy to compute and expected-log-optimal with respect to any stopping time. Simple e-variables were previously only known to exist in quite specific settings, but we offer a unifying theorem on their existence for testing exponential families. We start with a simple alternative $Q$ and a regular exponential family null. Together these induce a second exponential family ${\cal Q}$ containing $Q$, with the same sufficient statistic as the null. Our theorem shows that simple e-variables exist whenever the covariance matrices of ${\cal Q}$ and the null are in a certain relation. Examples in which this relation holds include some $k$-sample tests, Gaussian location- and scale tests, and tests for more general classes of natural exponential families.</p>
