In the simulations, the maximum likelihood methodology is the one that presents the best results, followed by multiple imputation with five imputations, which is the second best. The methods are applied to a case study on the obesity for schoolchildren in the municipality of Viana do Castelo, North Portugal, where a logistic regression model is used to predict the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) indicator from physical examinations and the past values of the obesity status. All the variables in the case study are potentially missing, with gender as the only exception. The results provided by the several methods are in well agreement, indicating the relevance of the past values of IOTF and physical scores for the prediction of obesity.

  <p>In this work logistic regression when both the response and the predictor variables may be missing is considered. Several existing approaches are reviewed, including complete case analysis, inverse probability weighting, multiple imputation and maximum likelihood. The methods are compared in a simulation study, which serves to evaluate the bias, the variance and the mean squared error of the estimators for the regression coefficients. In the simulations, the maximum likelihood methodology is the one that presents the best results, followed by multiple imputation with five imputations, which is the second best. The methods are applied to a case study on the obesity for schoolchildren in the municipality of Viana do Castelo, North Portugal, where a logistic regression model is used to predict the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) indicator from physical examinations and the past values of the obesity status. All the variables in the case study are potentially missing, with gender as the only exception. The results provided by the several methods are in well agreement, indicating the relevance of the past values of IOTF and physical scores for the prediction of obesity. Practical recommendations are given.</p>
