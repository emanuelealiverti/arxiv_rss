  <p>We introduce a powerful deep classifier two-sample test for high-dimensional data based on E-values, called E-value Classifier Two-Sample Test (E-C2ST). Our test combines ideas from existing work on split likelihood ratio tests and predictive independence tests. The resulting E-values are suitable for anytime-valid sequential two-sample tests. This feature allows for more effective use of data in constructing test statistics. Through simulations and real data applications, we empirically demonstrate that E-C2ST achieves enhanced statistical power by partitioning datasets into multiple batches beyond the conventional two-split (training and testing) approach of standard classifier two-sample tests. This strategy increases the power of the test while keeping the type I error well below the desired significance level.</p>
