  <p>With the rapid development of earth observation technology, we have entered an era of massively available satellite remote-sensing data. However, a large amount of satellite remote sensing data lacks a label or the label cost is too high to hinder the potential of AI technology mining satellite data. Especially in such an emergency response scenario that uses satellite data to evaluate the degree of disaster damage. Disaster damage assessment encountered bottlenecks due to excessive focus on the damage of a certain building in a specific geographical space or a certain area on a larger scale. In fact, in the early days of disaster emergency response, government departments were more concerned about the overall damage rate of the disaster area instead of single-building damage, because this helps the government decide the level of emergency response. We present an innovative algorithm that constructs Neyman stratified random sampling trees for binary classification and extends this approach to multiclass problems. Through extensive experimentation on various datasets and model structures, our findings demonstrate that our method surpasses both passive and conventional active learning techniques in terms of class rate estimation and model enhancement with only 30\%-60\% of the annotation cost of simple sampling. It effectively addresses the ‘sampling bias’ challenge in traditional active learning strategies and mitigates the ‘cold start’ dilemma.
