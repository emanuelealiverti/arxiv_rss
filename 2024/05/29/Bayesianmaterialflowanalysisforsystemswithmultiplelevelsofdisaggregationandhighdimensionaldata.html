  <p>Material Flow Analysis (MFA) is used to quantify and understand the life cycles of materials from production to end of use, which enables environmental, social and economic impacts and interventions. MFA is challenging as available data is often limited and uncertain, leading to an underdetermined system with an infinite number of possible stocks and flows values. Bayesian statistics is an effective way to address these challenges by principally incorporating domain knowledge, and quantifying uncertainty in the data and providing probabilities associated with model solutions.
  This paper presents a novel MFA methodology under the Bayesian framework. By relaxing the mass balance constraints, we improve the computational scalability and reliability of the posterior samples compared to existing Bayesian MFA methods. We propose a mass based, child and parent process framework to model systems with disaggregated processes and flows. We show posterior predictive checks can be used to identify inconsistencies in the data and aid noise and hyperparameter selection. The proposed approach is demonstrated on case studies, including a global aluminium cycle with significant disaggregation, under weakly informative priors and significant data gaps to investigate the feasibility of Bayesian MFA. We illustrate just a weakly informative prior can greatly improve the performance of Bayesian methods, for both estimation accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</p>
