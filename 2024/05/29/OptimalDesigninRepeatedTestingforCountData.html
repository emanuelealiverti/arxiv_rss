  <p>In this paper, we develop optimal designs for growth curve models with count data based on the Rasch Poisson-Gamma counts (RPGCM) model. This model is often used in educational and psychological testing when test results yield count data. In the RPGCM, the test scores are determined by respondents ability and item difficulty. Locally D-optimal designs are derived for maximum quasi-likelihood estimation to efficiently estimate the mean abilities of the respondents over time. Using the log link, both unstructured, linear and nonlinear growth curves of log mean abilities are taken into account. Finally, the sensitivity of the derived optimal designs due to an imprecise choice of parameter values is analyzed using D-efficiency.</p>
