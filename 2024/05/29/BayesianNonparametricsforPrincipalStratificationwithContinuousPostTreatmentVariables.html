<meta name="description" content="Principal stratification provides a causal inference framework that allows adjustment for confounded post-treatment variables when comparing treatments. Although the literature has focused mainly on binary post-treatment variables, there is a growing interest in principal stratification involving continuous post-treatment variables. However, characterizing the latent principal strata with a continuous post-treatment presents a significant challenge, which is further complicated in observational studies where the treatment is not randomized. In this paper, we introduce the Confounders-Aware SHared atoms BAyesian mixture (CASBAH), a novel approach for principal stratification with continuous post-treatment variables that can be directly applied to observational studies. CASBAH leverages a dependent Dirichlet process, utilizing shared atoms across treatment levels, to effectively control for measured confounders and facilitate information sharing between treatment groups in the identification of principal strata membership. CASBAH also offers a comprehensive quantification of uncertainty surrounding the membership of the principal strata. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed methodology has excellent performance in characterizing the latent principal strata and estimating the effects of treatment on post-treatment variables and outcomes. Finally, CASBAH is applied to a case study in which we estimate the causal effects of US national air quality regulations on pollution levels and health outcomes." />

  <p>Principal stratification provides a causal inference framework that allows adjustment for confounded post-treatment variables when comparing treatments. Although the literature has focused mainly on binary post-treatment variables, there is a growing interest in principal stratification involving continuous post-treatment variables. However, characterizing the latent principal strata with a continuous post-treatment presents a significant challenge, which is further complicated in observational studies where the treatment is not randomized. In this paper, we introduce the Confounders-Aware SHared atoms BAyesian mixture (CASBAH), a novel approach for principal stratification with continuous post-treatment variables that can be directly applied to observational studies. CASBAH leverages a dependent Dirichlet process, utilizing shared atoms across treatment levels, to effectively control for measured confounders and facilitate information sharing between treatment groups in the identification of principal strata membership. CASBAH also offers a comprehensive quantification of uncertainty surrounding the membership of the principal strata. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the proposed methodology has excellent performance in characterizing the latent principal strata and estimating the effects of treatment on post-treatment variables and outcomes.
