  <p>L-moments are expected values of linear combinations of order statistics that provide robust alternatives to traditional moments. The estimation of parametric models by matching sample L-moments has been shown to outperform maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in small samples from popular distributions. The choice of the number of L-moments to be used in estimation remains ad-hoc, though: researchers typically set the number of L-moments equal to the number of parameters, as to achieve an order condition for identification. This approach is generally inefficient in larger samples. In this paper, we show that, by properly choosing the number of L-moments and weighting these accordingly, we are able to construct an estimator that outperforms MLE in finite samples, and yet does not suffer from efficiency losses asymptotically. We do so by considering a “generalised” method of L-moments estimator and deriving its asymptotic properties in a framework where the number of L-moments varies with sample size. We then propose methods to automatically select the number of L-moments in a given sample. Monte Carlo evidence shows our proposed approach is able to outperform (in a mean-squared error sense) MLE in smaller samples, whilst working as well as it in larger samples. We then consider extensions of our approach to conditional and semiparametric models, and apply the latter to study expenditure patterns in a ridesharing platform in Brazil.</p>
