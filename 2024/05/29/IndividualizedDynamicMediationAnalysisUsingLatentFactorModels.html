<meta name="description" content="Mediation analysis plays a crucial role in causal inference as it can investigate the pathways through which treatment influences outcome. Most existing mediation analysis assumes that mediation effects are static and homogeneous within populations. However, mediation effects usually change over time and exhibit significant heterogeneity in many real-world applications. Additionally, the presence of unobserved confounding variables imposes a significant challenge to inferring both causal effect and mediation effect. To address these issues, we propose an individualized dynamic mediation analysis method. Our approach can identify the significant mediators of the population level while capturing the time-varying and heterogeneous mediation effects via latent factor modeling on coefficients of structural equation models. Another advantage of our method is that we can infer individualized mediation effects in the presence of unmeasured time-varying confounders. We provide estimation consistency for our proposed causal estimand and selection consistency for significant mediators. Extensive simulation studies and an application to a DNA methylation study demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method." />

  <p>Mediation analysis plays a crucial role in causal inference as it can investigate the pathways through which treatment influences outcome. Most existing mediation analysis assumes that mediation effects are static and homogeneous within populations. However, mediation effects usually change over time and exhibit significant heterogeneity in many real-world applications. Additionally, the presence of unobserved confounding variables imposes a significant challenge to inferring both causal effect and mediation effect. To address these issues, we propose an individualized dynamic mediation analysis method. Our approach can identify the significant mediators of the population level while capturing the time-varying and heterogeneous mediation effects via latent factor modeling on coefficients of structural equation models. Another advantage of our method is that we can infer individualized mediation effects in the presence of unmeasured time-varying confounders. We provide estimation consistency for our proposed causal estimand and selection consistency for significant mediators. Extensive simulation studies and an application to a DNA methylation study demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</p>
