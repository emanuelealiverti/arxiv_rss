  <h1>Permutation time irreversibility in sleep electroencephalograms: Dependence on sleep stage and the effect of equal values</h1>

  <p>Time irreversibility (TIR) refers to the manifestation of nonequilibrium brain activity influenced by various physiological conditions; however, the influence of sleep on electroencephalogram (EEG) TIR has not been sufficiently investigated. In this paper, a comprehensive study on permutation TIR (pTIR) of EEG data under different sleep stages is conducted. Two basic ordinal patterns (i.e., the original and amplitude permutations) are distinguished to simplify sleep EEGs, and then the influences of equal values and forbidden permutation on pTIR are elucidated. To detect pTIR of brain electric signals, 5 groups of EEGs in the awake, stages I, II, III, and rapid eye movement (REM) stages are collected from the public Polysomnographic Database in PhysioNet. Test results suggested that the pTIR of sleep EEGs significantly decreases as the sleep stage increases (p&lt;0.001), with the awake and REM EEGs, demonstrating greater differences than others. Comparative analysis and numerical simulations support the importance of equal values. Distribution of equal states, a simple quantification of amplitude fluctuations, significantly increases with the sleep stage (p&lt;0.001). If these equalities are ignored, incorrect probabilistic differences may arise in the forward-backward and symmetric permutations of TIR, leading to contradictory results; moreover, the ascending and descending orders for symmetric permutations also lead different outcomes in sleep EEGs. Overall, pTIR in sleep EEGs contributes to our understanding of quantitative TIR and classification of sleep EEGs.</p>
