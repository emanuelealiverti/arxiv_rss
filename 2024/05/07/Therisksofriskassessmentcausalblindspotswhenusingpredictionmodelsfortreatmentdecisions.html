  <p>Prediction models are increasingly proposed for guiding treatment decisions, but most fail to address the special role of treatments, leading to inappropriate use. This paper highlights the limitations of using standard prediction models for treatment decision support. We identify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">causal blind spots' in three common approaches to handling treatments in prediction modelling: including treatment as a predictor, restricting data based on treatment status and ignoring treatments. When predictions are used to inform treatment decisions, confounders, colliders and mediators, as well as changes in treatment protocols over time may lead to misinformed decision-making. We illustrate potential harmful consequences in several medical applications. We advocate for an extension of guidelines for development, reporting and evaluation of prediction models to ensure that the intended use of the model is matched to an appropriate risk estimand. When prediction models are intended to inform treatment decisions, prediction models should specify upfront the treatment decisions they aim to support and target a prediction estimand in line with that goal. This requires a shift towards developing predictions under the specific treatment options under consideration (</code>predictions under interventions’). Predictions under interventions need causal reasoning and inference techniques during development and validation. We argue that this will improve the efficacy of prediction models in guiding treatment decisions and prevent potential negative effects on patient outcomes.</p>
