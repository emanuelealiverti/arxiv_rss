<meta name="description" content="Our paper deals with a collection of networks on a common set of nodes, where some of the networks are associated with responses. Assuming that the networks correspond to points on a one-dimensional manifold in a higher dimensional ambient space, we propose an algorithm to consistently predict the response at an unlabeled network.

  <p>Our paper deals with a collection of networks on a common set of nodes, where some of the networks are associated with responses. Assuming that the networks correspond to points on a one-dimensional manifold in a higher dimensional ambient space, we propose an algorithm to consistently predict the response at an unlabeled network. Our model involves a specific multiple random network model, namely the common subspace independent edge model, where the networks share a common invariant subspace, and the heterogeneity amongst the networks is captured by a set of low dimensional matrices. Our algorithm estimates these low dimensional matrices that capture the heterogeneity of the networks, learns the underlying manifold by isomap, and consistently predicts the response at an unlabeled network. We provide theoretical justifications for the use of our algorithm, validated by numerical simulations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our algorithm on larval Drosophila connectome data.</p>
