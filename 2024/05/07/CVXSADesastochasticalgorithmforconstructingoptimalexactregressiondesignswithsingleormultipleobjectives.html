  <p>We propose an algorithm to construct optimal exact designs (EDs). Most of the work in the optimal regression design literature focuses on the approximate design (AD) paradigm due to its desired properties, including the optimality verification conditions derived by Kiefer (1959, 1974). ADs may have unbalanced weights, and practitioners may have difficulty implementing them with a designated run size $n$. Some EDs are constructed using rounding methods to get an integer number of runs at each support point of an AD, but this approach may not yield optimal results. To construct EDs, one may need to perform new combinatorial constructions for each $n$, and there is no unified approach to construct them. Therefore, we develop a systematic way to construct EDs for any given $n$. Our method can transform ADs into EDs while retaining high statistical efficiency in two steps. The first step involves constructing an AD by utilizing the convex nature of many design criteria. The second step employs a simulated annealing algorithm to search for the ED stochastically. Through several applications, we demonstrate the utility of our method for various design problems. Additionally, we show that the design efficiency approaches unity as the number of design points increases.</p>
