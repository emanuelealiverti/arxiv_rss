  <p>A generic family of distributions, defined on the surface of a curved torus is introduced using the area element of it. The area uniformity and the maximum entropy distribution are identified using the trigonometric moments of the proposed family. A marginal distribution is obtained as a three-parameter modification of the von Mises distribution that encompasses the von Mises, Cardioid, and Uniform distributions as special cases. The proposed family of the marginal distribution exhibits both symmetric and asymmetric, unimodal or bimodal shapes, contingent upon parameters. Furthermore, we scrutinize a two-parameter symmetric submodel, examining its moments, measure of variation, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and maximum likelihood estimation, among other properties. In addition, we introduce a modified acceptance-rejection sampling with a thin envelope obtained from the upper-Riemann-sum of a circular density, achieving a high rate of acceptance. This proposed sampling scheme will accelerate the empirical studies for a large-scale simulation reducing the processing time. Furthermore, we extend the Uniform, Wrapped Cauchy, and Kato-Jones distributions to the surface of the curved torus and implemented the proposed bivariate toroidal distribution for different groups of protein data, namely, $\alpha$-helix, $\beta$-sheet, and their mixture. A marginal of this proposed distribution is fitted to the wind direction data.</p>
