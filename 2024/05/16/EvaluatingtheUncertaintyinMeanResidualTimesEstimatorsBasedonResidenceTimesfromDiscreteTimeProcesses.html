  <h1>Evaluating the Uncertainty in Mean Residual Times: Estimators Based on Residence Times from Discrete Time Processes</h1>
  <br>Hernán R. Sánchez, Javier Garcia</h3>
  <br> [stat.ME]

  <p>In this work, we propose estimators for the uncertainty in mean residual times that require, for their evaluation, statistically independent individual residence times obtained from a discrete time process. We examine their performance through numerical experiments involving well-known probability distributions, and an application example using molecular dynamics simulation results, from an aqueous NaCl solution, is provided. These computationally inexpensive estimators, capable of achieving very accurate outcomes, serve as useful tools for assessing and reporting uncertainties in mean residual times across a wide range of simulations.</p>
