  <p>We consider the problem of indirect comparison, where a treatment arm of interest is absent by design in the target randomized control trial (RCT) but available in a source RCT. The identifiability of the target population average treatment effect often relies on conditional transportability assumptions. However, it is a common concern whether all relevant effect modifiers are measured and controlled for. We highlight a new proximal identification result in the presence of shifted, unobserved effect modifiers based on proxies: an adjustment proxy in both RCTs and an additional reweighting proxy in the source RCT. We propose an estimator which is doubly-robust against misspecifications of the so-called bridge functions and asymptotically normal under mild consistency of the nuisance models. An alternative estimator is presented to accommodate missing outcomes in the source RCT, which we then apply to conduct a proximal indirect comparison analysis using two weight management trials.</p>
