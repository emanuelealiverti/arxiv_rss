  <h1>Efficient Sampling in Disease Surveillance through Subpopulations: Sampling Canaries in the Coal Mine</h1>

  <p>We consider disease outbreak detection settings where the population under study consists of various subpopulations available for stratified surveillance. These subpopulations can for example be based on age cohorts, but may also correspond to other subgroups of the population under study such as international travellers. Rather than sampling uniformly over the entire population, one may elevate the effectiveness of the detection methodology by optimally choosing a subpopulation for sampling. We show (under some assumptions) the relative sampling efficiency between two subpopulations is inversely proportional to the ratio of their respective baseline disease risks. This leads to a considerable potential increase in sampling efficiency when sampling from the subpopulation with higher baseline disease risk, if the two subpopulation baseline risks differ strongly. Our mathematical results require a careful treatment of the power curves of exact binomial tests as a function of their sample size, which are erratic and non-monotonic due to the discreteness of the underlying distribution. Subpopulations with comparatively high baseline disease risk are typically in greater contact with health professionals, and thus when sampled for surveillance purposes this is typically motivated merely through a convenience argument. With this study, we aim to elevate the status of such “convenience surveillance” to optimal subpopulation surveillance.</p>
