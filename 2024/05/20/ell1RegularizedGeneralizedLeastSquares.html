  <p>In this paper we propose an $\ell_1$-regularized GLS estimator for high-dimensional regressions with potentially autocorrelated errors. We establish non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for estimation accuracy in a framework that allows for highly persistent autoregressive errors. In practice, the Whitening matrix required to implement the GLS is unkown, we present a feasible estimator for this matrix, derive consistency results and ultimately show how our proposed feasible GLS can recover closely the optimal performance (as if the errors were a white noise) of the LASSO. A simulation study verifies the performance of the proposed method, demonstrating that the penalized (feasible) GLS-LASSO estimator performs on par with the LASSO in the case of white noise errors, whilst outperforming it in terms of sign-recovery and estimation error when the errors exhibit significant correlation.</p>
