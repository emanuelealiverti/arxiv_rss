  <p>By relaxing conditions for natural structure learning algorithms, a family of constraint-based algorithms containing all exact structure learning algorithms under the faithfulness assumption, we define localised natural structure learning algorithms (LoNS). We also provide a set of necessary and sufficient assumptions for consistency of LoNS, which can be thought of as a strict relaxation of the restricted faithfulness assumption. We provide a practical LoNS algorithm that runs in exponential time, which is then compared with related existing structure learning algorithms, namely PC/SGS and the relatively recent Sparsest Permutation algorithm. Simulation studies are also provided.</p>
