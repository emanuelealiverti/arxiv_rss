  <p>When the marginal causal effect comparing the same treatment pair is available from multiple trials, we wish to transport all results to make inference on the target population effect. To account for the differences between populations, statistical analysis is often performed controlling for relevant variables. However, when transportability assumptions are placed on conditional causal effects, rather than the distribution of potential outcomes, we need to carefully choose these effect measures. In particular, we present identifiability results in two cases: target population average treatment effect for a continuous outcome and causal mean ratio for a positive outcome. We characterize the semiparametric efficiency bounds of the causal effects under the respective transportability assumptions and propose estimators that are doubly robust against model misspecifications. We highlight an important discussion on the tension between the non-collapsibility of conditional effects and the variational independence induced by transportability in the case of multiple source trials.</p>
