<meta name="description" content="We explore the globular cluster population of NGC 1052-DF4, a dark matter deficient galaxy, using Bayesian inference to search for the presence of rotation. The existence of such a rotating component is relevant to the estimation of the mass of the galaxy, and therefore the question of whether NGC 1052-DF4 is truly deficient of dark matter, similar to NGC 1052-DF2 another galaxy in the same group. The rotational characteristics of seven globular clusters in NGC 1052-DF4 were investigated, finding that a non-rotating kinematic model has a higher Bayesian evidence than a rotating model, by a factor of approximately 2.5. In addition, we find that under the assumption of rotation, its amplitude must be small. This distinct lack of rotation strengthens the case that, based on its intrinsic velocity dispersion, NGC 1052-DF4 is a truly dark matter deficient galaxy." />

  <p>We explore the globular cluster population of NGC 1052-DF4, a dark matter deficient galaxy, using Bayesian inference to search for the presence of rotation. The existence of such a rotating component is relevant to the estimation of the mass of the galaxy, and therefore the question of whether NGC 1052-DF4 is truly deficient of dark matter, similar to NGC 1052-DF2 another galaxy in the same group. The rotational characteristics of seven globular clusters in NGC 1052-DF4 were investigated, finding that a non-rotating kinematic model has a higher Bayesian evidence than a rotating model, by a factor of approximately 2.5. In addition, we find that under the assumption of rotation, its amplitude must be small. This distinct lack of rotation strengthens the case that, based on its intrinsic velocity dispersion, NGC 1052-DF4 is a truly dark matter deficient galaxy.</p>
