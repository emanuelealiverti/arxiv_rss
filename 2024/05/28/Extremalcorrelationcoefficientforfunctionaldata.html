  <h1>Extremal correlation coefficient for functional data</h1>
  <br>Mihyun Kim, Piotr Kokoszka</h3>
  <br> [stat.ME,stat.TH]

  <p>We propose a coefficient that measures dependence in paired samples of functions. It has properties similar to the Pearson correlation, but differs in significant ways: 1) it is designed to measure dependence between curves, 2) it focuses only on extreme curves. The new coefficient is derived within the framework of regular variation in Banach spaces. A consistent estimator is proposed and justified by an asymptotic analysis and a simulation study. The usefulness of the new coefficient is illustrated on financial and and climate functional data.</p>
