<meta name="description" content="Uncertainty quantification for multi-view learning is motivated by the increasing use of multi-view data in scientific problems. A common variant of multi-view learning is late fusion: train separate predictors on individual views and combine them after single-view predictions are available. Existing methods for uncertainty quantification for late fusion often rely on undesirable distributional assumptions for validity. Conformal prediction is one approach that avoids such distributional assumptions. However, naively applying conformal prediction to late-stage fusion pipelines often produces overly conservative and uninformative prediction regions, limiting its downstream utility. We propose a novel methodology, Multi-View Conformal Prediction (MVCP), where conformal prediction is instead performed separately on the single-view predictors and only fused subsequently. Our framework extends the standard scalar formulation of a score function to a multivariate score that produces more efficient downstream prediction regions in both classification and regression settings.

  <p>Uncertainty quantification for multi-view learning is motivated by the increasing use of multi-view data in scientific problems. A common variant of multi-view learning is late fusion: train separate predictors on individual views and combine them after single-view predictions are available. Existing methods for uncertainty quantification for late fusion often rely on undesirable distributional assumptions for validity. Conformal prediction is one approach that avoids such distributional assumptions. However, naively applying conformal prediction to late-stage fusion pipelines often produces overly conservative and uninformative prediction regions, limiting its downstream utility. We propose a novel methodology, Multi-View Conformal Prediction (MVCP), where conformal prediction is instead performed separately on the single-view predictors and only fused subsequently. Our framework extends the standard scalar formulation of a score function to a multivariate score that produces more efficient downstream prediction regions in both classification and regression settings. We then demonstrate that such improvements can be realized in methods built atop conformalized regressors, specifically in robust predict-then-optimize pipelines.</p>
