  <p>Bayesian hypothesis tests leverage posterior probabilities, Bayes factors, or credible intervals to inform data-driven decision making. We propose a framework for power curve approximation with such hypothesis tests. We present a fast approach to explore the approximate sampling distribution of posterior probabilities when the conditions for the Bernstein-von Mises theorem are satisfied. We extend that approach to consider segments of such sampling distributions in a targeted manner for each sample size explored. These sampling distribution segments are used to construct power curves for various types of posterior analyses. Our resulting method for power curve approximation is orders of magnitude faster than conventional power curve estimation for Bayesian hypothesis tests. We also prove the consistency of the corresponding power estimates and sample size recommendations under certain conditions.</p>
