  <p>We propose a novel method of network detection that is robust against any complex dependence structure. Our goal is to conduct exploratory network detection, meaning that we attempt to detect a network composed of ``connectable’’ edges that are worth investigating in detail for further modelling or precise network analysis. For a reproducible network detection, we pursuit high power while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). In particular, we formalize the problem as a multiple testing, and propose p-variables that are used in the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We show that the proposed method controls the FDR under arbitrary dependence structure with any sample size, and has asymptotic power one. The validity is also confirmed by simulations and a real data example.</p>
