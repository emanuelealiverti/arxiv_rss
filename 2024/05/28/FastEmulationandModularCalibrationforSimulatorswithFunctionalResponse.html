  <p>Scalable surrogate models enable efficient emulation of computer models (or simulators), particularly when dealing with large ensembles of runs. While Gaussian Process (GP) models are commonly employed for emulation, they face limitations in scaling to truly large datasets. Furthermore, when dealing with dense functional output, such as spatial or time-series data, additional complexities arise, requiring careful handling to ensure fast emulation. This work presents a highly scalable emulator for functional data, building upon the works of Kennedy and O’Hagan (2001) and Higdon et al. (2008), while incorporating the local approximate Gaussian Process framework proposed by Gramacy and Apley (2015). The emulator utilizes global GP lengthscale parameter estimates to scale the input space, leading to a substantial improvement in prediction speed. We demonstrate that our fast approximation-based emulator can serve as a viable alternative to the methods outlined in Higdon et al. (2008) for functional response, while drastically reducing computational costs. The proposed emulator is applied to quickly calibrate the multiphysics continuum hydrodynamics simulator FLAG with a large ensemble of 20000 runs. The methods presented are implemented in the R package FlaGP.</p>
