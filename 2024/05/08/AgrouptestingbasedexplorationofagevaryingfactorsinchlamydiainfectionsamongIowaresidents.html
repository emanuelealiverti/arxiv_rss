<meta name="description" content="Group testing, a method that screens subjects in pooled samples rather than individually, has been employed as a cost-effective strategy for chlamydia screening among Iowa residents. In efforts to deepen our understanding of chlamydia epidemiology in Iowa, several group testing regression models have been proposed. Different than previous approaches, we expand upon the varying coefficient model to capture potential age-varying associations with chlamydia infection risk. In general, our model operates within a Bayesian framework, allowing regression associations to vary with a covariate of key interest. We employ a stochastic search variable selection process for regularization in estimation. Additionally, our model can integrate random effects to consider potential geographical factors and estimate unknown assay accuracy probabilities. The performance of our model is assessed through comprehensive simulation studies. Upon application to the Iowa group testing dataset, we reveal a significant age-varying racial disparity in chlamydia infections. We believe this discovery has the potential to inform the enhancement of interventions and prevention strategies, leading to more effective chlamydia control and management, thereby promoting health equity across all populations." />

  <p>Group testing, a method that screens subjects in pooled samples rather than individually, has been employed as a cost-effective strategy for chlamydia screening among Iowa residents. In efforts to deepen our understanding of chlamydia epidemiology in Iowa, several group testing regression models have been proposed. Different than previous approaches, we expand upon the varying coefficient model to capture potential age-varying associations with chlamydia infection risk. In general, our model operates within a Bayesian framework, allowing regression associations to vary with a covariate of key interest. We employ a stochastic search variable selection process for regularization in estimation. Additionally, our model can integrate random effects to consider potential geographical factors and estimate unknown assay accuracy probabilities. The performance of our model is assessed through comprehensive simulation studies. Upon application to the Iowa group testing dataset, we reveal a significant age-varying racial disparity in chlamydia infections. We believe this discovery has the potential to inform the enhancement of interventions and prevention strategies, leading to more effective chlamydia control and management, thereby promoting health equity across all populations.</p>
