Nevertheless, by focusing exclusively on prediction accuracy, the Forecast Hub fails to evaluate whether the proposed models have similar performance across social determinants that have been known to play a role in the COVID-19 pandemic including race, ethnicity and urbanization level. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive fairness analysis of the Forecast Hub model predictions and we show statistically significant diverse predictive performance across social determinants, with minority racial and ethnic groups as well as less urbanized areas often associated with higher prediction errors. We hope this work will encourage COVID-19 modelers and the CDC to report fairness metrics together with accuracy, and to reflect on the potential harms of the models on specific social groups and contexts." />

  <p>The COVID-19 Forecast Hub, a repository of COVID-19 forecasts from over 50 independent research groups, is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for their official COVID-19 communications. As such, the Forecast Hub is a critical centralized resource to promote transparent decision making. Nevertheless, by focusing exclusively on prediction accuracy, the Forecast Hub fails to evaluate whether the proposed models have similar performance across social determinants that have been known to play a role in the COVID-19 pandemic including race, ethnicity and urbanization level. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive fairness analysis of the Forecast Hub model predictions and we show statistically significant diverse predictive performance across social determinants, with minority racial and ethnic groups as well as less urbanized areas often associated with higher prediction errors. We hope this work will encourage COVID-19 modelers and the CDC to report fairness metrics together with accuracy, and to reflect on the potential harms of the models on specific social groups and contexts.</p>
