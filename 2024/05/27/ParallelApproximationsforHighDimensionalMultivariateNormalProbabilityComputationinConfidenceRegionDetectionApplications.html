  <p>Addressing the statistical challenge of computing the multivariate normal (MVN) probability in high dimensions holds significant potential for enhancing various applications. One common way to compute high-dimensional MVN probabilities is the Separation-of-Variables (SOV) algorithm. This algorithm is known for its high computational complexity of O(n^3) and space complexity of O(n^2), mainly due to a Cholesky factorization operation for an n X n covariance matrix, where $n$ represents the dimensionality of the MVN problem. This work proposes a high-performance computing framework that allows scaling the SOV algorithm and, subsequently, the confidence region detection algorithm. The framework leverages parallel linear algebra algorithms with a task-based programming model to achieve performance scalability in computing process probabilities, especially on large-scale systems. In addition, we enhance our implementation by incorporating Tile Low-Rank (TLR) approximation techniques to reduce algorithmic complexity without compromising the necessary accuracy. To evaluate the performance and accuracy of our framework, we conduct assessments using simulated data and a wind speed dataset. Our proposed implementation effectively handles high-dimensional multivariate normal (MVN) probability computations on shared and distributed-memory systems using finite precision arithmetics and TLR approximation computation. Performance results show a significant speedup of up to 20X in solving the MVN problem using TLR approximation compared to the reference dense solution without sacrificing the application’s accuracy.
