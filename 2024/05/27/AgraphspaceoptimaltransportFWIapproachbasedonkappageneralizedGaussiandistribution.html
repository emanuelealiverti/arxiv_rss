  <p>The statistical basis for conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI) approaches is commonly associated with Gaussian statistics. However, errors are rarely Gaussian in non-linear problems like FWI. In this work, we investigate the portability of a new objective function for FWI applications based on the graph-space optimal transport and $\kappa$-generalized Gaussian probability distribution. In particular, we demonstrate that the proposed objective function is robust in mitigating two critical problems in FWI, which are associated with cycle skipping issues and non-Gaussian errors. The results reveal that our proposal can mitigate the negative influence of cycle-skipping ambiguity and non-Gaussian noises and reduce the computational runtime for computing the transport plan associated with the optimal transport theory.</p>
