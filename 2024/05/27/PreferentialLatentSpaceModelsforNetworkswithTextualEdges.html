<meta name="description" content="Many real-world networks contain rich textual information in the edges, such as email networks where an edge between two nodes is an email exchange. Other examples include co-author networks and social media networks. The useful textual information carried in the edges is often discarded in most network analyses, resulting in an incomplete view of the relationships between nodes. In this work, we propose to represent the text document between each pair of nodes as a vector counting the appearances of keywords extracted from the corpus, and introduce a new and flexible preferential latent space network model that can offer direct insights on how contents of the textual exchanges modulate the relationships between nodes. We establish identifiability conditions for the proposed model and tackle model estimation with a computationally efficient projected gradient descent algorithm. We further derive the non-asymptotic error bound of the estimator from each step of the algorithm.

  <p>Many real-world networks contain rich textual information in the edges, such as email networks where an edge between two nodes is an email exchange. Other examples include co-author networks and social media networks. The useful textual information carried in the edges is often discarded in most network analyses, resulting in an incomplete view of the relationships between nodes. In this work, we propose to represent the text document between each pair of nodes as a vector counting the appearances of keywords extracted from the corpus, and introduce a new and flexible preferential latent space network model that can offer direct insights on how contents of the textual exchanges modulate the relationships between nodes. We establish identifiability conditions for the proposed model and tackle model estimation with a computationally efficient projected gradient descent algorithm. We further derive the non-asymptotic error bound of the estimator from each step of the algorithm. The efficacy of our proposed method is demonstrated through simulations and an analysis of the Enron email network.</p>
