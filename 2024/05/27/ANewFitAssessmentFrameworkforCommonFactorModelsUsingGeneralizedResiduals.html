  <p>Standard common factor models, such as the linear normal factor model, rely on strict parametric assumptions, which require rigorous model-data fit assessment to prevent fallacious inferences. However, overall goodness-of-fit diagnostics conventionally used in factor analysis do not offer diagnostic information on where the misfit originates. In the current work, we propose a new fit assessment framework for common factor models by extending the theory of generalized residuals (Haberman &amp; Sinharay, 2013). This framework allows for the flexible adaptation of test statistics to identify various sources of misfit. In addition, the resulting goodness-of-fit tests provide more informative diagnostics, as the evaluation is performed conditionally on latent variables. Several examples of test statistics suitable for assessing various model assumptions are presented within this framework, and their performance is evaluated by simulation studies and a real data example.</p>
