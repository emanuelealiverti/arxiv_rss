<meta name="description" content="Probabilistic graphical models are widely used to model complex systems under uncertainty. Traditionally, Gaussian directed graphical models are applied for analysis of large networks with continuous variables as they can provide conditional and marginal distributions in closed form simplifying the inferential task. The Gaussianity and linearity assumptions are often adequate, yet can lead to poor performance when dealing with some practical applications. In this paper, we model each variable in graph G as a polynomial regression of its parents to capture complex relationships between individual variables and with a utility function of polynomial form. We develop a message-passing algorithm to propagate information throughout the network solely using moments which enables the expected utility scores to be calculated exactly. Our propagation method scales up well and enables to perform inference in terms of a finite number of expectations.

  <p>Probabilistic graphical models are widely used to model complex systems under uncertainty. Traditionally, Gaussian directed graphical models are applied for analysis of large networks with continuous variables as they can provide conditional and marginal distributions in closed form simplifying the inferential task. The Gaussianity and linearity assumptions are often adequate, yet can lead to poor performance when dealing with some practical applications. In this paper, we model each variable in graph G as a polynomial regression of its parents to capture complex relationships between individual variables and with a utility function of polynomial form. We develop a message-passing algorithm to propagate information throughout the network solely using moments which enables the expected utility scores to be calculated exactly. Our propagation method scales up well and enables to perform inference in terms of a finite number of expectations. We illustrate how the proposed methodology works with examples and in an application to decision problems in energy planning and for real-time clinical decision support.</p>
