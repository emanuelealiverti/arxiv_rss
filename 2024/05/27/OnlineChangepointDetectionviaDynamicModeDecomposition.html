<meta name="description" content="Detecting changes in data streams is a vital task in many applications. There is increasing interest in changepoint detection in the online setting, to enable real-time monitoring and support prompt responses and informed decision-making. Many approaches assume stationary sequences before encountering an abrupt change in the mean or variance. Notably less attention has focused on the challenging case where the monitored sequences exhibit trend, periodicity and seasonality. Dynamic mode decomposition is a data-driven dimensionality reduction technique that extracts the essential components of a dynamical system. We propose a changepoint detection method that leverages this technique to sequentially model the dynamics of a moving window of data and produce a low-rank reconstruction. A change is identified when there is a significant difference between this reconstruction and the observed data, and we provide theoretical justification for this approach. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach has superior detection performance compared to other methods for detecting small changes in mean, variance, periodicity, and second-order structure, among others, in data that exhibits seasonality. Results on real-world datasets also show excellent performance compared to contemporary approaches." />

  <p>Detecting changes in data streams is a vital task in many applications. There is increasing interest in changepoint detection in the online setting, to enable real-time monitoring and support prompt responses and informed decision-making. Many approaches assume stationary sequences before encountering an abrupt change in the mean or variance. Notably less attention has focused on the challenging case where the monitored sequences exhibit trend, periodicity and seasonality. Dynamic mode decomposition is a data-driven dimensionality reduction technique that extracts the essential components of a dynamical system. We propose a changepoint detection method that leverages this technique to sequentially model the dynamics of a moving window of data and produce a low-rank reconstruction. A change is identified when there is a significant difference between this reconstruction and the observed data, and we provide theoretical justification for this approach. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach has superior detection performance compared to other methods for detecting small changes in mean, variance, periodicity, and second-order structure, among others, in data that exhibits seasonality. Results on real-world datasets also show excellent performance compared to contemporary approaches.</p>
