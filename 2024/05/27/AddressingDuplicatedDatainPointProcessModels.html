  <p>Spatial point process models are widely applied to point pattern data from various fields in the social and environmental sciences. However, a serious hurdle in fitting point process models is the presence of duplicated points, wherein multiple observations share identical spatial coordinates. This often occurs because of decisions made in the geo-coding process, such as assigning representative locations (e.g., aggregate-level centroids) to observations when data producers lack exact location information. Because spatial point process models like the Log-Gaussian Cox Process (LGCP) assume unique locations, researchers often employ {\it ad hoc} solutions (e.g., jittering) to address duplicated data before analysis. As an alternative, this study proposes a Modified Minimum Contrast (MMC) method that adapts the inference procedure to account for the effect of duplicates without needing to alter the data. The proposed MMC method is applied to LGCP models, with simulation results demonstrating the gains of our method relative to existing approaches in terms of parameter estimation. Interestingly, simulation results also show the effect of the geo-coding process on parameter estimates, which can be utilized in the implementation of the MMC method. The MMC approach is then used to infer the spatial clustering characteristics of conflict events in Afghanistan (2008-2009).</p>
