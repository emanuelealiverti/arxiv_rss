  <p>In this paper, we develop a new and effective approach to nonparametric quantile regression that accommodates ultrahigh-dimensional data arising from spatio-temporal processes. This approach proves advantageous in staving off computational challenges that constitute known hindrances to existing nonparametric quantile regression methods when the number of predictors is much larger than the available sample size. We investigate conditions under which estimation is feasible and of good overall quality and obtain sharp approximations that we employ to devising statistical inference methodology. These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences. Additionally, we provide finite-sample results through various simulations which, accompanied by an illustrative application to real-worldesque data (on electricity demand), offer guarantees on the performance of the proposed methodology.</p>
