  <p>Graphical models for cardinal paired comparison data with and without covariates are rigorously analyzed. Novel, graph–based, necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee strong consistency, asymptotic normality and the exponential convergence of the estimated ranks are emphasized. A complete theory for models with covariates is laid out. In particular conditions under which covariates can be safely omitted from the model are provided. The methodology is employed in the analysis of both finite and infinite sets of ranked items specifically in the case of large sparse comparison graphs. The proposed methods are explored by simulation and applied to the ranking of teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA).</p>
