  <p>For nearly a century, social researchers and psychologists have debated the efficacy of psychometric scales for attitude measurement, focusing on Thurstone’s equal appearing interval scales and Likert’s summated rating scales. Thurstone scales fell out of favour due to the labour intensive process of gathering judges’ opinions on the initial items. However, advancements in technology have mitigated these challenges, nullifying the simplicity advantage of Likert scales, which have their own methodological issues. This study explores a methodological experiment to develop a Thurstone scale for assessing attitudes towards individuals living with AIDS. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to a group of judges, including undergraduate, postgraduate, and PhD students from disciplines such as social policy, law, medicine, and computer engineering, alongside established social researchers, and their responses were statistically analysed. The primary innovation of this study is the incorporation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Large Language Model (LLM) to evaluate the initial 63 items, comparing its assessments with those of the human judges. Interestingly, the AI provided also detailed explanations for its categorisation.
