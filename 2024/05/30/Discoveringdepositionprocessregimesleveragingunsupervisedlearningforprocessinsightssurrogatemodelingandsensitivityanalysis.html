  <p>This work introduces a comprehensive approach utilizing data-driven methods to elucidate the deposition process regimes in Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) reactors and the interplay of physical mechanism that dominate in each one of them. Through this work, we address three key objectives. Firstly, our methodology relies on process outcomes, derived by a detailed CFD model, to identify clusters of “outcomes” corresponding to distinct process regimes, wherein the relative influence of input variables undergoes notable shifts. This phenomenon is experimentally validated through Arrhenius plot analysis, affirming the efficacy of our approach. Secondly, we demonstrate the development of an efficient surrogate model, based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), that maintains accuracy, facilitating streamlined computational analyses. Finally, as a result of PCE, sensitivity analysis is made possible by means of Sobol’ indices, that quantify the impact of process inputs across identified regimes.
