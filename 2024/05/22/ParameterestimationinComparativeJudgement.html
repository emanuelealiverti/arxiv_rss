  <p>Comparative Judgement is an assessment method where item ratings are estimated based on rankings of subsets of the items. These rankings are typically pairwise, with ratings taken to be the estimated parameters from fitting a Bradley-Terry model. Likelihood penalization is often employed. Adaptive scheduling of the comparisons can increase the efficiency of the assessment. We show that the most commonly used penalty is not the best-performing penalty under adaptive scheduling and can lead to substantial bias in parameter estimates. We demonstrate this using simulated and real data and provide a theoretical explanation for the relative performance of the penalties considered. Further, we propose a superior approach based on bootstrapping. It is shown to produce better parameter estimates for adaptive schedules and to be robust to variations in underlying strength distributions and initial penalization method.</p>
