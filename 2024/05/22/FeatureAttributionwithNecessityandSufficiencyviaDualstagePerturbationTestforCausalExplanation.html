However, such perturbation tests may not accurately distinguish the contributions of different features, when their change in prediction is the same after perturbation. In order to enhance the ability of FAMs to distinguish different features’ contributions in this challenging setting, we propose to utilize the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS) that perturbing a feature is a necessary and sufficient cause for the prediction to change as a measure of feature importance.
