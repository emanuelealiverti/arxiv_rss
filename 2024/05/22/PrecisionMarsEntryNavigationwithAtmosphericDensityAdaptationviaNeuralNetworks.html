  <p>Spacecraft entering Mars require precise navigation algorithms capable of accurately estimating the vehicle’s position and velocity in dynamic and uncertain atmospheric environments. Discrepancies between the true Martian atmospheric density and the onboard density model can significantly impair the performance of spacecraft entry navigation filters. This work introduces a new approach to online filtering for Martian entry using a neural network to estimate atmospheric density and employing a consider analysis to account for the uncertainty in the estimate. The network is trained on an exponential atmospheric density model, and its parameters are dynamically adapted in real time to account for any mismatch between the true and estimated densities. The adaptation of the network is formulated as a maximum likelihood problem by leveraging the measurement innovations of the filter to identify optimal network parameters. Within the context of the maximum likelihood approach, incorporating a neural network enables the use of stochastic optimizers known for their efficiency in the machine learning domain. Performance comparisons are conducted against two online adaptive approaches, covariance matching and state augmentation and correction, in various realistic Martian entry navigation scenarios. The results show superior estimation accuracy compared to other approaches, and precise alignment of the estimated density with a broad selection of realistic Martian atmospheres sampled from perturbed Mars-GRAM data.</p>
