  <p>Epidemics are inherently stochastic, and stochastic models provide an appropriate way to describe and analyse such phenomena. Given temporal incidence data consisting of, for example, the number of new infections or removals in a given time window, a continuous-time discrete-valued Markov process provides a natural description of the dynamics of each model component, typically taken to be the number of susceptible, exposed, infected or removed individuals. Fitting the SEIR model to time-course data is a challenging problem due incomplete observations and, consequently, the intractability of the observed data likelihood. Whilst sampling based inference schemes such as Markov chain Monte Carlo are routinely applied, their computational cost typically restricts analysis to data sets of no more than a few thousand infective cases. Instead, we develop a sequential inference scheme that makes use of a computationally cheap approximation of the most natural Markov process model. Crucially, the resulting model allows a tractable conditional parameter posterior which can be summarised in terms of a set of low dimensional statistics. This is used to rejuvenate parameter samples in conjunction with a novel bridge construct for propagating state trajectories conditional on the next observation of cumulative incidence. The resulting inference framework also allows for stochastic infection and reporting rates. We illustrate our approach using synthetic and real data applications.</p>
