  <p>Many interventions in causal inference can be represented as transformations. We identify a local symmetry property satisfied by a large class of causal models under such interventions. Where present, this symmetry can be characterized by a type of map called a cocycle, an object that is central to dynamical systems theory. We show that such cocycles exist under general conditions and are sufficient to identify interventional and counterfactual distributions. We use these results to derive cocycle-based estimators for causal estimands and show they achieve semiparametric efficiency under typical conditions. Since (infinitely) many distributions can share the same cocycle, these estimators make causal inference robust to mis-specification by sidestepping superfluous modelling assumptions. We demonstrate both robustness and state-of-the-art performance in several simulations, and apply our method to estimate the effects of 401(k) pension plan eligibility on asset accumulation using a real dataset.</p>
