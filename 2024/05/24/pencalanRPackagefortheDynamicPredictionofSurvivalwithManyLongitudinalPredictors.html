  <p>In survival analysis, longitudinal information on the health status of a patient can be used to dynamically update the predicted probability that a patient will experience an event of interest. Traditional approaches to dynamic prediction such as joint models become computationally unfeasible with more than a handful of longitudinal covariates, warranting the development of methods that can handle a larger number of longitudinal covariates. We introduce the R package pencal, which implements a Penalized Regression Calibration approach that makes it possible to handle many longitudinal covariates as predictors of survival. pencal uses mixed-effects models to summarize the trajectories of the longitudinal covariates up to a prespecified landmark time, and a penalized Cox model to predict survival based on both baseline covariates and summary measures of the longitudinal covariates. This article illustrates the structure of the R package, provides a step by step example showing how to estimate PRC, compute dynamic predictions of survival and validate performance, and shows how parallelization can be used to significantly reduce computing time.</p>
