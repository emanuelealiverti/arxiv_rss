  <p>We propose a novel and robust online function-on-scalar regression technique via geometric median to learn associations between functional responses and scalar covariates based on massive or streaming datasets. The online estimation procedure, developed using the average stochastic gradient descent algorithm, offers an efficient and cost-effective method for analyzing sequentially augmented datasets, eliminating the need to store large volumes of data in memory. We establish the almost sure consistency, $L_p$ convergence, and asymptotic normality of the online estimator. To enable efficient and fast inference of the parameters of interest, including the derivation of confidence intervals, we also develop an innovative two-step online bootstrap procedure to approximate the limiting error distribution of the robust online estimator. Numerical studies under a variety of scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed online learning method. A real application analyzing PM$_{2.5}$ air-quality data is also included to exemplify the proposed online approach.</p>
