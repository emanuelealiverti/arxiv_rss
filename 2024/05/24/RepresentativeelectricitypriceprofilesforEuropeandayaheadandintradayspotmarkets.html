  <h1>Representative electricity price profiles for European day-ahead and intraday spot markets</h1>

  <p>We propose a method to construct representative price profiles of the day-ahead (DA) and the intraday (ID) electricity spot markets and use this method to provide examples of ready-to-use price data sets. In contrast to common scenario generation approaches, the method is deterministic and relies on a small number of degrees of freedom, with the aim to be well defined and easy to use. We thereby target an enhanced comparability of future research studies on demand-side management and energy cost optimization. We construct the price profiles based on historical time series from the spot markets of interest, e.g., European Power Exchange (EPEX) spot. To this end, we extract key price components from the data while also accounting for known dominant mechanisms in the price variation. Further, the method is able to preserve key statistical features of the historical data (e.g., mean and standard deviation) when constructing the benchmark profile. Finally, our approach ensures comparability of ID and DA price profiles by design, as their cumulative (integral) price can be made identical if needed.</p>
