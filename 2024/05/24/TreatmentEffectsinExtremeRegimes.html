  <p>Understanding treatment effects in extreme regimes is important for characterizing risks associated with different interventions. This is hindered by the unavailability of counterfactual outcomes and the rarity and difficulty of collecting extreme data in practice. To address this issue, we propose a new framework based on extreme value theory for estimating treatment effects in extreme regimes. We quantify these effects using variations in tail decay rates of potential outcomes in the presence and absence of treatments. We establish algorithms for calculating these quantities and develop related theoretical results. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on various standard synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.</p>
