  <p>High-dimensional penalized rank regression is a powerful tool for modeling high-dimensional data due to its robustness and estimation efficiency. However, the non-smoothness of the rank loss brings great challenges to the computation. To solve this critical issue, high-dimensional convoluted rank regression is recently proposed, and penalized convoluted rank regression estimators are introduced. However, these developed estimators cannot be directly used to make inference. In this paper, we investigate the inference problem of high-dimensional convoluted rank regression. We first establish estimation error bounds of penalized convoluted rank regression estimators under weaker conditions on the predictors. Based on the penalized convoluted rank regression estimators, we further introduce a debiased estimator. We then provide Bahadur representation for our proposed estimator. We further develop simultaneous inference procedures. A novel bootstrap procedure is proposed and its theoretical validity is also established. Finally, simulation and real data analysis are conducted to illustrate the merits of our proposed methods.</p>
