  <p>The standard pipeline to analyse single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) often involves two steps : clustering and Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) to annotate cell populations based on gene expression. However, using clustering results for data-driven hypothesis formulation compromises statistical properties, especially Type I error control. Data fission was introduced to split the information contained in each observation into two independent parts that can be used for clustering and testing. However, data fission was originally designed for non-mixture distributions, and adapting it for mixtures requires knowledge of the unknown clustering structure to estimate component-specific scale parameters. As components are typically unavailable in practice, scale parameter estimators often exhibit bias. We explicitly quantify how this bias affects subsequent post-clustering differential analysis Type I error rate despite employing data fission. In response, we propose a novel approach that involves modeling each observation as a realization of its distribution, with scale parameters estimated non-parametrically.
