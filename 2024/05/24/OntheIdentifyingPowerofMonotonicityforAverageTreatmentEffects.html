  <p>In the context of a binary outcome, treatment, and instrument, Balke and Pearl (1993, 1997) establish that adding monotonicity to the instrument exogeneity assumption does not decrease the identified sets for average potential outcomes and average treatment effect parameters when those assumptions are consistent with the distribution of the observable data. We show that the same results hold in the broader context of multi-valued outcome, treatment, and instrument. An important example of such a setting is a multi-arm randomized controlled trial with noncompliance.</p>
