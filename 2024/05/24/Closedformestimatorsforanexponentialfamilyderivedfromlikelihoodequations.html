  <h1>Closed-form estimators for an exponential family derived from likelihood equations</h1>

  <br> [stat.ME]

  <p>In this paper, we derive closed-form estimators for the parameters of some probability distributions belonging to the exponential family. A bootstrap bias-reduced version of these proposed closed-form estimators are also derived. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed for the assessment of the estimators. The results are seen to be quite favorable to the proposed bootstrap bias-reduce estimators.</p>
