<meta name="description" content="This work addresses the pressing need for cybersecurity in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), particularly focusing on the challenges of identifying UAVs using radiofrequency (RF) fingerprinting in constrained environments. The complexity and variability of RF signals, influenced by environmental interference and hardware imperfections, often render traditional RF-based identification methods ineffective. To address these complications, the study introduces the rigorous use of one-shot generative methods for augmenting transformed RF signals, offering a significant improvement in UAV identification. This approach shows promise in low-data regimes, outperforming deep generative methods like conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). The paper provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of one-shot generative models in augmenting limited data, setting a precedent for their application in limited RF environments. This research not only contributes to the cybersecurity of UAVs but also rigorously broadens the scope of machine learning techniques in data-constrained scenarios, which may include atypical complex sequences beyond images and videos." />

  <p>This work addresses the pressing need for cybersecurity in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), particularly focusing on the challenges of identifying UAVs using radiofrequency (RF) fingerprinting in constrained environments. The complexity and variability of RF signals, influenced by environmental interference and hardware imperfections, often render traditional RF-based identification methods ineffective. To address these complications, the study introduces the rigorous use of one-shot generative methods for augmenting transformed RF signals, offering a significant improvement in UAV identification. This approach shows promise in low-data regimes, outperforming deep generative methods like conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). The paper provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of one-shot generative models in augmenting limited data, setting a precedent for their application in limited RF environments.
