<meta name="description" content="This tutorial discusses methodology for causal inference using longitudinal modified treatment policies. This method facilitates the mathematical formalization, identification, and estimation of many novel parameters, and mathematically generalizes many commonly used parameters, such as the average treatment effect. Longitudinal modified treatment policies apply to a wide variety of exposures, including binary, multivariate, and continuous, and can accommodate time-varying treatments and confounders, competing risks, loss-to-follow-up, as well as survival, binary, or continuous outcomes. Longitudinal modified treatment policies can be seen as an extension of static and dynamic interventions to involve the natural value of treatment, and, like dynamic interventions, can be used to define alternative estimands with a positivity assumption that is more likely to be satisfied than estimands corresponding to static interventions. This tutorial aims to illustrate several practical uses of the longitudinal modified treatment policy methodology, including describing different estimation strategies and their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. We provide numerous examples of types of research questions which can be answered using longitudinal modified treatment policies. We go into more depth with one of these examples–specifically, estimating the effect of delaying intubation on critically ill COVID-19 patients’ mortality. We demonstrate the use of the open-source R package lmtp to estimate the effects, and we provide code on https://github.com/kathoffman/lmtp-tutorial." />
