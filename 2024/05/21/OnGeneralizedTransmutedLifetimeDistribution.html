  <p>This article presents a new class of generalized transmuted lifetime distributions which includes a large number of lifetime distributions as sub-family. Several important mathematical quantities such as density function, distribution function, quantile function, moments, moment generating function, stress-strength reliability function, order statistics, R'enyi and q-entropy, residual and reversed residual life function, and cumulative information generating function are obtained. The methods of maximum likelihood, ordinary least square, weighted least square, Cram'er-von Mises, Anderson Darling, and Right-tail Anderson Darling are considered to estimate the model parameters in a general way. Further, a well-organized Monte Carlo simulation experiments have been performed to observe the behavior of the estimators. Finally, two real data have also been analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distribution in real-life modeling.</p>
