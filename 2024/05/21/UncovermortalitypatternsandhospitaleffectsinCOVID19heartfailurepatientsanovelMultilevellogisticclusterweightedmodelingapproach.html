  <p>Evaluating hospitals’ performance and its relation to patients’ characteristics is of utmost importance to ensure timely, effective, and optimal treatment. Such a matter is particularly relevant in areas and situations where the healthcare system must contend with an unexpected surge in hospitalizations, such as for heart failure patients in the Lombardy region of Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Motivated by this issue, the paper introduces a novel Multilevel Logistic Cluster-Weighted Model (ML-CWMd) for predicting 45-day mortality following hospitalization due to COVID-19. The methodology flexibly accommodates dependence patterns among continuous, categorical, and dichotomous variables; effectively accounting for hospital-specific effects in distinct patient subgroups showing different attributes. A tailored Expectation-Maximization algorithm is developed for parameter estimation, and extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate its performance against competing models. The novel approach is applied to administrative data from the Lombardy Region, aiming to profile heart failure patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and investigate the hospital-level impact on their overall mortality.
