  <p>Despite the common occurrence of interference in Difference-in-Differences (DiD) applications, standard DiD methods rely on an assumption that interference is absent, and comparatively little work has considered how to accommodate and learn about spillover effects within a DiD framework. Here, we extend the so-called `DiD-SNMMs’ of Shahn et al (2022) to accommodate interference in a time-varying DiD setting. Doing so enables estimation of a richer set of effects than previous DiD approaches. For example, DiD-SNMMs do not assume the absence of spillover effects after direct exposures and can model how effects of direct or indirect (i.e. spillover) exposures depend on past and concurrent (direct or indirect) exposure and covariate history. We consider both cluster and network interference structures an illustrate the methodology in simulations.</p>
