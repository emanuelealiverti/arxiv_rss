  <p>We propose an operator learning approach to accelerate geometric Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for solving infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems (BIPs). While geometric MCMC employs high-quality proposals that adapt to posterior local geometry, it requires repeated computations of gradients and Hessians of the log-likelihood, which becomes prohibitive when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is defined through expensive-to-solve parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). We consider a delayed-acceptance geometric MCMC method driven by a neural operator surrogate of the PtO map, where the proposal exploits fast surrogate predictions of the log-likelihood and, simultaneously, its gradient and Hessian. To achieve a substantial speedup, the surrogate must accurately approximate the PtO map and its Jacobian, which often demands a prohibitively large number of PtO map samples via conventional operator learning methods. In this work, we present an extension of derivative-informed operator learning [O’Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] that uses joint samples of the PtO map and its Jacobian. This leads to derivative-informed neural operator (DINO) surrogates that accurately predict the observables and posterior local geometry at a significantly lower training cost than conventional methods. Cost and error analysis for reduced basis DINO surrogates are provided. Numerical studies demonstrate that DINO-driven MCMC generates effective posterior samples 3–9 times faster than geometric MCMC and 60–97 times faster than prior geometry-based MCMC. Furthermore, the training cost of DINO surrogates breaks even compared to geometric MCMC after just 10–25 effective posterior samples.</p>
