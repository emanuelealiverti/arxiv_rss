  <p>In this paper, we propose a model that indicates the asymmetry structure for cell probabilities in multivariate contingency tables with the same ordered categories. The proposed model is the closest to the symmetry model in terms of the $f$-divergence under certain conditions and incorporates various asymmetry models as special cases, including existing models. We elucidate the relationship between the proposed model and conventional models from several aspects of divergence in $f$-divergence. Furthermore, we provide theorems showing that the symmetry model can be decomposed into two or more models, each imposing less restrictive parameter constraints than the symmetry condition. We also discuss the properties of goodness-of-fit statistics, particularly focusing on the likelihood ratio test statistics and Wald test statistics. Finally, we summarize the proposed model and discuss some problems and future work.</p>
