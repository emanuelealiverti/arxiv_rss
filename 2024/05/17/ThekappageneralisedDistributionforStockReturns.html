  <h1>The $\kappa$-generalised Distribution for Stock Returns</h1>
  <br>Samuel Forbes</h3>
  <br> [stat.AP]

  <p>Empirical evidence shows stock returns are often heavy-tailed rather than normally distributed. The $\kappa$-generalised distribution, originated in the context of statistical physics by Kaniadakis, is characterised by the $\kappa$-exponential function that is asymptotically exponential for small values and asymptotically power law for large values. This proves to be a useful property and makes it a good candidate distribution for many types of quantities. In this paper we focus on fitting historic daily stock returns for the FTSE 100 and the top 100 Nasdaq stocks. Using a Monte-Carlo goodness of fit test there is evidence that the $\kappa$-generalised distribution is a good fit for a significant proportion of the 200 stock returns analysed.</p>
