  <p>Estimating causal effects under interference is pertinent to many real-world settings. However, the true interference network may be unknown to the practitioner, precluding many existing techniques that leverage this information. A recent line of work with low-order potential outcomes models uses staggered rollout designs to obtain unbiased estimators that require no network information. However, their use of polynomial extrapolation can lead to prohibitively high variance. To address this, we propose a two-stage experimental design that restricts treatment rollout to a sub-population. We analyze the bias and variance of an interpolation-style estimator under this experimental design. Through numerical simulations, we explore the trade-off between the error attributable to the subsampling of our experimental design and the extrapolation of the estimator. Under low-order interactions models with degree greater than 1, the proposed design greatly reduces the error of the polynomial interpolation estimator, such that it outperforms baseline estimators, especially when the treatment probability is small.</p>
