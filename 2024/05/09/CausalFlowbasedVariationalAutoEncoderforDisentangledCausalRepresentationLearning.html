<meta name="description" content="Disentangled representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional representations of data, where each dimension corresponds to an underlying generative factor. Currently, Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) are widely used for disentangled representation learning, with the majority of methods assuming independence among generative factors. However, in real-world scenarios, generative factors typically exhibit complex causal relationships. We thus design a new VAE-based framework named Disentangled Causal Variational Auto-Encoder (DCVAE), which includes a variant of autoregressive flows known as causal flows, capable of learning effective causal disentangled representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the disentanglement identifiability of DCVAE, ensuring that our model can effectively learn causal disentangled representations. The performance of DCVAE is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its outstanding capability in achieving causal disentanglement and performing intervention experiments. Moreover, DCVAE exhibits remarkable performance on downstream tasks and has the potential to learn the true causal structure among factors." />

  <p>Disentangled representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional representations of data, where each dimension corresponds to an underlying generative factor. Currently, Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) are widely used for disentangled representation learning, with the majority of methods assuming independence among generative factors. However, in real-world scenarios, generative factors typically exhibit complex causal relationships. We thus design a new VAE-based framework named Disentangled Causal Variational Auto-Encoder (DCVAE), which includes a variant of autoregressive flows known as causal flows, capable of learning effective causal disentangled representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of the disentanglement identifiability of DCVAE, ensuring that our model can effectively learn causal disentangled representations. The performance of DCVAE is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its outstanding capability in achieving causal disentanglement and performing intervention experiments. Moreover, DCVAE exhibits remarkable performance on downstream tasks and has the potential to learn the true causal structure among factors.</p>
