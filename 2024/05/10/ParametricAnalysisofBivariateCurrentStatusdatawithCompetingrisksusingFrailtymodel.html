  <p>Shared and correlated Gamma frailty models are widely used in the literature to model the association in multivariate current status data. In this paper, we have proposed two other new Gamma frailty models, namely shared cause-specific and correlated cause-specific Gamma frailty to capture association in bivariate current status data with competing risks. We have investigated the identifiability of the bivariate models with competing risks for each of the four frailty variables. We have considered maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. Thorough simulation studies have been performed to study the finite sample behaviour of the estimated parameters. Also, we have analyzed a real data set on hearing loss in two ears using Exponential type and Weibull type cause-specific baseline hazard functions with the four different Gamma frailty variables and compare the fits using AIC.</p>
