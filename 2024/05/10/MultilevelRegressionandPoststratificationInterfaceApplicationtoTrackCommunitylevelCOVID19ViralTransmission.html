  <p>In the absence of comprehensive or random testing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have developed a proxy method for synthetic random sampling to estimate the actual viral incidence in the community, based on viral RNA testing of asymptomatic patients who present for elective procedures within a hospital system. The approach collects routine testing data on SARS-CoV-2 exposure among outpatients and performs statistical adjustments of sample representation using multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP). MRP adjusts for selection bias and yields stable small area estimates. We have developed an open-source, user-friendly MRP interface for public implementation of the statistical workflow. We illustrate the MRP interface with an application to track community-level COVID-19 viral transmission in the state of Michigan.</p>
