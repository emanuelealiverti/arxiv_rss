  <p>System reliability analysis aims at computing the probability of failure of an engineering system given a set of uncertain inputs and limit state functions. Active-learning solution schemes have been shown to be a viable tool but as of yet they are not as efficient as in the context of component reliability analysis. This is due to some peculiarities of system problems, such as the presence of multiple failure modes and their uneven contribution to failure, or the dependence on the system configuration (e.g., series or parallel). In this work, we propose a novel active learning strategy designed for solving general system reliability problems. This algorithm combines subset simulation and Kriging/PC-Kriging, and relies on an enrichment scheme tailored to specifically address the weaknesses of this class of methods. More specifically, it relies on three components: (i) a new learning function that does not require the specification of the system configuration, (ii) a density-based clustering technique that allows one to automatically detect the different failure modes, and (iii) sensitivity analysis to estimate the contribution of each limit state to system failure so as to select only the most relevant ones for enrichment. The proposed method is validated on two analytical examples and compared against results gathered in the literature. Finally, a complex engineering problem related to power transmission is solved, thereby showcasing the efficiency of the proposed method in a real-case scenario.</p>
