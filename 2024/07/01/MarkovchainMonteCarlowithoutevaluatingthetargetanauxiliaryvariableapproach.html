  <p>In sampling tasks, it is common for target distributions to be known up to a normalising constant. However, in many situations, evaluating even the unnormalised distribution can be costly or infeasible. This issue arises in scenarios such as sampling from the Bayesian posterior for tall datasets and the ‘doubly-intractable’ distributions. In this paper, we begin by observing that seemingly different Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the exchange algorithm, PoissonMH, and TunaMH, can be unified under a simple common procedure. We then extend this procedure into a novel framework that allows the use of auxiliary variables in both the proposal and acceptance-rejection steps. We develop the theory of the new framework, applying it to existing algorithms to simplify and extend their results. Several new algorithms emerge from this framework, with improved performance demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets.</p>
