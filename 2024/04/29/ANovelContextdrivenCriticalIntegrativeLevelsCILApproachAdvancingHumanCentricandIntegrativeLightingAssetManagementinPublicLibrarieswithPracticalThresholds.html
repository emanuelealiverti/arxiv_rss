<meta name="description" content="This paper proposes the context driven Critical Integrative Levels (CIL), a novel approach to lighting asset management in public libraries that aligns with the transformative vision of human-centric and integrative lighting. This approach encompasses not only the visual aspects of lighting performance but also prioritizes the physiological and psychological well-being of library users. Incorporating a newly defined metric, Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE), the approach quantifies user-light interaction, enabling tailored lighting strategies that respond to diverse activities and needs in library spaces. Case studies demonstrate how the CIL matrix can be practically applied, offering significant improvements over conventional methods by focusing on optimized user experiences from both visual impacts and non-visual effects." />

  <p>This paper proposes the context driven Critical Integrative Levels (CIL), a novel approach to lighting asset management in public libraries that aligns with the transformative vision of human-centric and integrative lighting. This approach encompasses not only the visual aspects of lighting performance but also prioritizes the physiological and psychological well-being of library users. Incorporating a newly defined metric, Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE), the approach quantifies user-light interaction, enabling tailored lighting strategies that respond to diverse activities and needs in library spaces. Case studies demonstrate how the CIL matrix can be practically applied, offering significant improvements over conventional methods by focusing on optimized user experiences from both visual impacts and non-visual effects.</p>
