  <h1>Consistent information criteria for regularized regression and loss-based learning problems</h1>

  <p>Many problems in statistics and machine learning can be formulated as model selection problems, where the goal is to choose an optimal parsimonious model among a set of candidate models. It is typical to conduct model selection by penalizing the objective function via information criteria (IC), as with the pioneering work by Akaike and Schwarz. Via recent work, we propose a generalized IC framework to consistently estimate general loss-based learning problems. In this work, we propose a consistent estimation method for Generalized Linear Model (GLM) regressions by utilizing the recent IC developments. We advance the generalized IC framework by proposing model selection problems, where the model set consists of a potentially uncountable set of models. In addition to theoretical expositions, our proposal introduces a computational procedure for the implementation of our methods in the finite sample setting, which we demonstrate via an extensive simulation study.</p>
