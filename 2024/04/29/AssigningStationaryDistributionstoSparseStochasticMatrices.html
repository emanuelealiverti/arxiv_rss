  <h1>Assigning Stationary Distributions to Sparse Stochastic Matrices</h1>

  <p>The target stationary distribution problem (TSDP) is the following: given an irreducible stochastic matrix $G$ and a target stationary distribution $\hat \mu$, construct a minimum norm perturbation, $\Delta$, such that $\hat G = G+\Delta$ is also stochastic and has the prescribed target stationary distribution, $\hat \mu$. In this paper, we revisit the TSDP under a constraint on the support of $\Delta$, that is, on the set of non-zero entries of $\Delta$. This is particularly meaningful in practice since one cannot typically modify all entries of $G$. We first show how to construct a feasible solution $\hat G$ that has essentially the same support as the matrix $G$. Then we show how to compute globally optimal and sparse solutions using the component-wise $\ell_1$ norm and linear optimization. We propose an efficient implementation that relies on a column-generation approach which allows us to solve sparse problems of size up to $10^5 \times 10^5$ in a few minutes. We illustrate the proposed algorithms with several numerical experiments.</p>
