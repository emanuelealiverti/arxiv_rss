  <h1>Comparison results for Markov tree distributions</h1>

  <p>We develop comparison results for Markov tree distributions extending ordering results from the literature on discrete time Markov processes and recently studied ordering results for conditionally independent factor models to tree structures. Based on fairly natural positive dependence conditions, our main contribution is a comparison result with respect to the supermodular order. Since this order is a pure dependence order, it has many applications in optimal transport, finance, and insurance. As an illustrative example, we consider hidden Markov models and study distributional robustness for functionals of the random walk under model uncertainty. Further, we show that, surprisingly, more general comparison results via the recently established rearrangement-based Schur order for conditional distributions, which implies an ordering of Chatterjee’s rank correlation, do not carry over from star structures to trees. Several examples and a detailed discussion of the assumptions demonstrate the generality of our results and provide further insights into the behavior of multidimensional distributions.</p>
