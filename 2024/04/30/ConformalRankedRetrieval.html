  <p>Given the wide adoption of ranked retrieval techniques in various information systems that significantly impact our daily lives, there is an increasing need to assess and address the uncertainty inherent in their predictions. This paper introduces a novel method using the conformal risk control framework to quantitatively measure and manage risks in the context of ranked retrieval problems. Our research focuses on a typical two-stage ranked retrieval problem, where the retrieval stage generates candidates for subsequent ranking. By carefully formulating the conformal risk for each stage, we have developed algorithms to effectively control these risks within their specified bounds. The efficacy of our proposed methods has been demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on three large-scale public datasets for ranked retrieval tasks, including the MSLR-WEB dataset, the Yahoo LTRC dataset and the MS MARCO dataset.</p>
