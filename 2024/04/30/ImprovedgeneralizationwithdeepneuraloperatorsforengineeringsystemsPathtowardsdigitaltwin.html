More importantly, when evaluated on unseen scenarios (zero shot feature), the trained models exhibit excellent generalization ability. This underscores ONets vital niche for surrogate modeling and digital twin development across physical systems. While convection-diffusion poses a greater challenge, the results confirm the promise of ONets and motivate further enhancements to the DeepONet algorithm.
