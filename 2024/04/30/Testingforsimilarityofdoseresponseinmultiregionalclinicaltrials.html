  <p>This paper addresses the problem of deciding whether the dose response relationships between subgroups and the full population in a multi-regional trial are similar to each other. Similarity is measured in terms of the maximal deviation between the dose response curves. We consider a parametric framework and develop two powerful bootstrap tests for the similarity between the dose response curves of one subgroup and the full population, and for the similarity between the dose response curves of several subgroups and the full population. We prove the validity of the tests, investigate the finite sample properties by means of a simulation study and finally illustrate the methodology in a case study.</p>
