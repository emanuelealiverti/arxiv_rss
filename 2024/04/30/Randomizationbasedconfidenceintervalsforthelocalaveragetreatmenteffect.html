  <p>We consider the problem of generating confidence intervals in randomized experiments with noncompliance. We show that a refinement of a randomization-based procedure proposed by Imbens and Rosenbaum (2005) has desirable properties. Namely, we show that using a studentized Anderson-Rubin-type statistic as a test statistic yields confidence intervals that are finite-sample exact under treatment effect homogeneity, and remain asymptotically valid for the Local Average Treatment Effect when the treatment effect is heterogeneous. We provide a uniform analysis of this procedure.</p>
