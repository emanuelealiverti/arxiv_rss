<meta name="description" content="Markov random fields (MRFs) are invaluable tools across diverse fields, and spatiotemporal MRFs (STMRFs) amplify their effectiveness by integrating spatial and temporal dimensions. However, modeling spatiotemporal data introduces additional hurdles, including dynamic spatial dimensions and partial observations, prevalent in scenarios like disease spread analysis and environmental monitoring. Tracking high-dimensional targets with complex spatiotemporal interactions over extended periods poses significant challenges in accuracy, efficiency, and computational feasibility. To tackle these obstacles, we introduce the variable target MRF scalable particle filter (VT-MRF-SPF), a fully online learning algorithm designed for high-dimensional target tracking over STMRFs with varying dimensions under partial observation. We rigorously guarantee algorithm performance, explicitly indicating overcoming the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, we provide practical guidelines for tuning graphical parameters, leading to superior performance in extensive examinations." />

  <p>Markov random fields (MRFs) are invaluable tools across diverse fields, and spatiotemporal MRFs (STMRFs) amplify their effectiveness by integrating spatial and temporal dimensions. However, modeling spatiotemporal data introduces additional hurdles, including dynamic spatial dimensions and partial observations, prevalent in scenarios like disease spread analysis and environmental monitoring. Tracking high-dimensional targets with complex spatiotemporal interactions over extended periods poses significant challenges in accuracy, efficiency, and computational feasibility. To tackle these obstacles, we introduce the variable target MRF scalable particle filter (VT-MRF-SPF), a fully online learning algorithm designed for high-dimensional target tracking over STMRFs with varying dimensions under partial observation.
