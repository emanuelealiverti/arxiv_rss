  <p>Causal inference methods for observational data are highly regarded due to their wide applicability. While there are already numerous methods available for de-confounding bias, these methods generally assume that covariates consist solely of confounders or make naive assumptions about the covariates. Such assumptions face challenges in both theory and practice, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional covariates. Relaxing these naive assumptions and identifying the confounding covariates that truly require correction can effectively enhance the practical significance of these methods. Therefore, this paper proposes a General Causal Inference (GCI) framework specifically designed for cross-sectional observational data, which precisely identifies the key confounding covariates and provides corresponding identification algorithm. Specifically, based on progressive derivations of the Markov property on Directed Acyclic Graph, we conclude that the key confounding covariates are equivalent to the common root ancestors of the treatment and the outcome variable. Building upon this conclusion, the GCI framework is composed of a novel Ancestor Set Identification (ASI) algorithm and de-confounding inference methods. Firstly, the ASI algorithm is theoretically supported by the conditional independence properties and causal asymmetry between variables, enabling the identification of key confounding covariates. Subsequently, the identified confounding covariates are used in the de-confounding inference methods to obtain unbiased causal effect estimation, which can support informed decision-making. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that the GCI framework can effectively identify the critical confounding covariates and significantly improve the precision, stability, and interpretability of causal inference in observational studies.</p>
