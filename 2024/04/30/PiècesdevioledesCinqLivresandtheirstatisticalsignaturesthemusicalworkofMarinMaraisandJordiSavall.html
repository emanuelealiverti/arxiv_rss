<meta name="description" content="This study analyzes the spectrum of audio signals related to the work of “Pi`eces de viole des Cinq Livres” based on the collaborative work between Marin Marais and Jordi Savall for the underlying musical information. In particular, we explore the identification of possible statistical signatures related to this musical work. Based on the complex systems approach, we compute the spectrum of audio signals, analyze and identify their best-fit statistical distributions, and plot their relative frequencies using the scientific pitch notation. Findings suggest that the collection of frequency components related to the spectrum of each of the books that form this audio work show highly skewed and associated statistical distributions. Therefore, the most frequent statistical distribution that best describes the collection of these audio data and may be associated with a singular statistical signature is the exponential." />

  <p>This study analyzes the spectrum of audio signals related to the work of “Pi`eces de viole des Cinq Livres” based on the collaborative work between Marin Marais and Jordi Savall for the underlying musical information. In particular, we explore the identification of possible statistical signatures related to this musical work. Based on the complex systems approach, we compute the spectrum of audio signals, analyze and identify their best-fit statistical distributions, and plot their relative frequencies using the scientific pitch notation. Findings suggest that the collection of frequency components related to the spectrum of each of the books that form this audio work show highly skewed and associated statistical distributions. Therefore, the most frequent statistical distribution that best describes the collection of these audio data and may be associated with a singular statistical signature is the exponential.</p>
