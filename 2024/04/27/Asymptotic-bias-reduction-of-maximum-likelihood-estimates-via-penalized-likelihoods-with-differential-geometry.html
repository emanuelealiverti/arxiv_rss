  <h1>Asymptotic bias reduction of maximum likelihood estimates via penalized likelihoods with differential geometry</h1>

  <p>A procedure for asymptotic bias reduction of maximum likelihood estimates of generic estimands is developed. The estimator is realized as a plug-in estimator, where the parameter maximizes the penalized likelihood with a penalty function that satisfies a quasi-linear partial differential equation of the first order. The integration of the partial differential equation with the aid of differential geometry is discussed. Applications to generalized linear models, linear mixed-effects models, and a location-scale family are presented.</p>
