  <h1>Robust estimations from distribution structures: III. Invariant Moments</h1>

  <p>Descriptive statistics for parametric models are currently highly sensative to departures, gross errors, and/or random errors. Here, leveraging the structures of parametric distributions and their central moment kernel distributions, a class of estimators, consistent simultanously for both a semiparametric distribution and a distinct parametric distribution, is proposed. These efficient estimators are robust to both gross errors and departures from parametric assumptions, making them ideal for estimating the mean and central moments of common unimodal distributions. This article opens up the possibility of utilizing the common nature of probability models to construct near-optimal estimators that are suitable for various scenarios.</p>
