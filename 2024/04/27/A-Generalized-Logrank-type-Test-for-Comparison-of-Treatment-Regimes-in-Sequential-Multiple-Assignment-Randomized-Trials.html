  <h1>A Generalized Logrank-type Test for Comparison of Treatment Regimes in Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials</h1>

  <p>The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is the
  ideal study design for the evaluation of multistage treatment
  regimes, which comprise sequential decision rules that recommend
  treatments for a patient at each of a series of decision points
  based on their evolving characteristics. A common goal is to
  compare the set of so-called embedded regimes represented in the
  design on the basis of a primary outcome of interest. In the study
  of chronic diseases and disorders, this outcome is often a time to
  an event, and a goal is to compare the distributions of the
  time-to-event outcome associated with each regime in the set. We
  present a general statistical framework in which we develop a
  logrank-type test for comparison of the survival distributions
  associated with regimes within a specified set based on the data
  from a SMART with an arbitrary number of stages that allows
  incorporation of covariate information to enhance efficiency and can
  also be used with data from an observational study. The framework
  provides clarification of the assumptions required to yield a
  principled test procedure, and the proposed test subsumes or offers
  an improved alternative to existing methods. We demonstrate
  performance of the methods in a suite of simulation
  studies. The methods are applied to a SMART in patients with acute
  promyelocytic leukemia.</p>
