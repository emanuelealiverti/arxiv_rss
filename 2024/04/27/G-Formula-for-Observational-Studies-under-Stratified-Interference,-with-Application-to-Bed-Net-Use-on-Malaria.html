  <h1>G-Formula for Observational Studies under Stratified Interference, with Application to Bed Net Use on Malaria</h1>

  <p>Assessing population-level effects of vaccines and other infectious disease prevention measures is important to the field of public health. In infectious disease studies, one person’s treatment may affect another individual’s outcome, i.e., there may be interference between units. For example, the use of bed nets to prevent malaria by one individual may have an indirect effect on other individuals living in close proximity. In some settings, individuals may form groups or clusters where interference only occurs within groups, i.e., there is partial interference. Inverse probability weighted estimators have previously been developed for observational studies with partial interference. Unfortunately, these estimators are not well suited for studies with large clusters. Therefore, in this paper, the parametric g-formula is extended to allow for partial interference. G-formula estimators are proposed for overall effects, effects when treated, and effects when untreated. The proposed estimators can accommodate large clusters and do not suffer from the g-null paradox that may occur in the absence of interference. The large sample properties of the proposed estimators are derived assuming no unmeasured confounders and that the partial interference takes a particular form (referred to as `weak stratified interference’). Simulation studies are presented demonstrating the finite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. The Demographic and Health Survey from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is then analyzed using the proposed g-formula estimators to assess the effects of bed net use on malaria.</p>
