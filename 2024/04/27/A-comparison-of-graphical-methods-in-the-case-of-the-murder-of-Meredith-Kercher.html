  <h1>A comparison of graphical methods in the case of the murder of Meredith Kercher</h1>

  <p>We compare three graphical methods for displaying evidence in a legal case: Wigmore Charts, Bayesian Networks and Chain Event Graphs. We find that these methods are aimed at three distinct audiences, respectively lawyers, forensic scientists and the police. The methods are illustrated using part of the evidence in the case of the murder of Meredith Kercher. More specifically, we focus on representing the list of propositions, evidence, testimony and facts given in the first trial against Raffaele Sollecito and Amanda Knox with these graphical methodologies.</p>
