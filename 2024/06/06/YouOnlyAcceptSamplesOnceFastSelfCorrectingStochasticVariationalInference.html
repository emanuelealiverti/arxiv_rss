  <p>We introduce YOASOVI, an algorithm for performing fast, self-correcting stochastic optimization for Variational Inference (VI) on large Bayesian heirarchical models. To accomplish this, we take advantage of available information on the objective function used for stochastic VI at each iteration and replace regular Monte Carlo sampling with acceptance sampling. Rather than spend computational resources drawing and evaluating over a large sample for the gradient, we draw only one sample and accept it with probability proportional to the expected improvement in the objective. The following paper develops two versions of the algorithm: the first one based on a naive intuition, and another building up the algorithm as a Metropolis-type scheme. Empirical results based on simulations and benchmark datasets for multivariate Gaussian mixture models show that YOASOVI consistently converges faster (in clock time) and within better optimal neighborhoods than both regularized Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo VI algorithms.</p>
