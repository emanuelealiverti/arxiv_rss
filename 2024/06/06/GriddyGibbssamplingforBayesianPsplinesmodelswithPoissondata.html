<meta name="description" content="P-splines are appealing for smoothing Poisson distributed counts. They provide a flexible setting for modeling nonlinear model components based on a discretized penalty structure with a relatively simple computational backbone. Under a Bayesian inferential process relying on Markov chain Monte Carlo, estimates of spline coefficients are typically obtained by means of Metropolis-type algorithms, which may suffer from convergence issues if the proposal distribution is not properly chosen.

In this model class, conditional posterior distributions of spline components are shown to have attractive mathematical properties. Despite their non-conjugate nature, conditional posteriors of spline coefficients can be efficiently explored with a Gibbs sampling scheme by relying on grid-based approximations. The proposed Griddy-Gibbs sampler for Bayesian P-splines (GGSBPS) algorithm is an interesting calibration-free tool for density estimation and histogram smoothing that is made available in a compact and user-friendly routine.

  <p>P-splines are appealing for smoothing Poisson distributed counts. They provide a flexible setting for modeling nonlinear model components based on a discretized penalty structure with a relatively simple computational backbone. Under a Bayesian inferential process relying on Markov chain Monte Carlo, estimates of spline coefficients are typically obtained by means of Metropolis-type algorithms, which may suffer from convergence issues if the proposal distribution is not properly chosen. To avoid such a sensitive calibration choice, we extend the Griddy-Gibbs sampler to Bayesian P-splines models with a Poisson response variable. In this model class, conditional posterior distributions of spline components are shown to have attractive mathematical properties. Despite their non-conjugate nature, conditional posteriors of spline coefficients can be efficiently explored with a Gibbs sampling scheme by relying on grid-based approximations. The proposed Griddy-Gibbs sampler for Bayesian P-splines (GGSBPS) algorithm is an interesting calibration-free tool for density estimation and histogram smoothing that is made available in a compact and user-friendly routine. The performance of our approach is assessed in different simulation settings and the GGSBPS algorithm is illustrated on two real datasets.</p>
