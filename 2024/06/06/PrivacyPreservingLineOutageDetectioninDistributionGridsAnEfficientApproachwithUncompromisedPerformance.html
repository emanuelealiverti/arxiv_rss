<meta name="description" content="Recent advancements in research have shown the efficacy of employing sensor measurements, such as voltage and power data, in identifying line outages within distribution grids. However, these measurements inadvertently pose privacy risks to electricity customers by potentially revealing their sensitive information, such as household occupancy and economic status, to adversaries. To safeguard raw data from direct exposure to third-party adversaries, this paper proposes a novel decentralized data encryption scheme. The effectiveness of this encryption strategy is validated via demonstration of its differential privacy attributes by studying the Gaussian differential privacy. Recognizing that the encryption of raw data could affect the efficacy of outage detection, this paper analyzes the performance degradation by examining the Kullback-Leibler divergence between data distributions before and after the line outage. This analysis allows us to further alleviate the performance degradation by designing an innovative detection statistic that accurately approximates the optimal one. Manipulating the variance of this statistic, we demonstrate its ability to approach the optimal detection performance. The proposed privacy-aware detection procedure is evaluated using representative distribution grids and real load profiles, covering 17 distinct outage configurations. Our empirical results confirm the privacy-preserving nature of our approach and show that it achieves comparable detection performance to the optimal baseline." />
