  <p>The macroeconomy is a sophisticated dynamic system involving significant uncertainties that complicate modelling. In response, decision makers consider multiple models that provide different predictions and policy recommendations which are then synthesized into a policy decision. In this setting, we introduce and develop Bayesian predictive decision synthesis (BPDS) to formalize monetary policy decision processes. BPDS draws on recent developments in model combination and statistical decision theory that yield new opportunities in combining multiple models, emphasizing the integration of decision goals, expectations and outcomes into the model synthesis process. Our case study concerns central bank policy decisions about target interest rates with a focus on implications for multi-step macroeconomic forecasting.</p>
