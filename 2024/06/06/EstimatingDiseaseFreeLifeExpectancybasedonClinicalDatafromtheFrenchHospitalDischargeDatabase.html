<meta name="description" content="The development of health indicators to measure healthy life expectancy (HLE) is an active field of research aimed at summarizing the health of a population. Although many health indicators have emerged in the literature as critical metrics in public health assessments, the methods and data to conduct this evaluation vary considerably in nature and quality. Traditionally, health data collection relies on population surveys. However, these studies, typically of limited size, encompass only a small yet representative segment of the population.

Through this research, we illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of employing large clinical datasets as the foundation for more robust health indicators. We shed light on the opportunities that such data offer for a more comprehensive understanding of the health status of a population. In particular, we estimate age-dependent hazard rates associated with sex, alcohol abuse, tobacco consumption, and obesity, as well as geographic location.
