<meta name="description" content="The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While some studies explore methods to mitigate copyright risks by steering the outputs of generative models away from those resembling copyrighted data, little attention has been paid to the question of how much of a resemblance is undesirable; more original or unique data are afforded stronger protection, and the threshold level of resemblance for constituting infringement correspondingly lower. Here, leveraging this principle, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be practically estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images." />

  <p>The rapid progress of generative AI technology has sparked significant copyright concerns, leading to numerous lawsuits filed against AI developers. While some studies explore methods to mitigate copyright risks by steering the outputs of generative models away from those resembling copyrighted data, little attention has been paid to the question of how much of a resemblance is undesirable; more original or unique data are afforded stronger protection, and the threshold level of resemblance for constituting infringement correspondingly lower. Here, leveraging this principle, we propose a genericization method that modifies the outputs of a generative model to make them more generic and less likely to infringe copyright. To achieve this, we introduce a metric for quantifying the level of originality of data in a manner that is consistent with the legal framework. This metric can be practically estimated by drawing samples from a generative model, which is then used for the genericization process. Experiments demonstrate that our genericization method successfully modifies the output of a text-to-image generative model so that it produces more generic, copyright-compliant images.</p>
