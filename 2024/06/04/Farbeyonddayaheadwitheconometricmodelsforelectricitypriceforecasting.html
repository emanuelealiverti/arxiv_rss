<meta name="description" content="The surge in global energy prices during the recent energy crisis, which peaked in 2022, has intensified the need for mid-term to long-term forecasting for hedging and valuation purposes. This study analyzes the statistical predictability of power prices before, during, and after the energy crisis, using econometric models with an hourly resolution. To stabilize the model estimates, we define fundamentally derived coefficient bounds. We provide an in-depth analysis of the unit root behavior of the power price series, showing that the long-term stochastic trend is explained by the prices of commodities used as fuels for power generation: gas, coal, oil, and emission allowances (EUA). However, as the forecasting horizon increases, spurious effects become extremely relevant, leading to highly significant but economically meaningless results. To mitigate these spurious effects, we propose the “current” model: estimating the current same-day relationship between power prices and their regressors and projecting this relationship into the future. This flexible and interpretable method is applied to hourly German day-ahead power prices for forecasting horizons up to one year ahead, utilizing a combination of regularized regression methods and generalized additive models." />

  <p>The surge in global energy prices during the recent energy crisis, which peaked in 2022, has intensified the need for mid-term to long-term forecasting for hedging and valuation purposes. This study analyzes the statistical predictability of power prices before, during, and after the energy crisis, using econometric models with an hourly resolution. To stabilize the model estimates, we define fundamentally derived coefficient bounds. We provide an in-depth analysis of the unit root behavior of the power price series, showing that the long-term stochastic trend is explained by the prices of commodities used as fuels for power generation: gas, coal, oil, and emission allowances (EUA). However, as the forecasting horizon increases, spurious effects become extremely relevant, leading to highly significant but economically meaningless results. To mitigate these spurious effects, we propose the “current” model: estimating the current same-day relationship between power prices and their regressors and projecting this relationship into the future. This flexible and interpretable method is applied to hourly German day-ahead power prices for forecasting horizons up to one year ahead, utilizing a combination of regularized regression methods and generalized additive models.</p>
