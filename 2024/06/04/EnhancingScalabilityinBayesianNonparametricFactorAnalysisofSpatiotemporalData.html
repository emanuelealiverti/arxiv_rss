  <p>This manuscript puts forward novel practicable spatiotemporal Bayesian factor analysis frameworks computationally feasible for moderate to large data. Our models exhibit significantly enhanced computational scalability and storage efficiency, deliver high overall modeling performances, and possess powerful inferential capabilities for adequately predicting outcomes at future time points or new spatial locations and satisfactorily clustering spatial locations into regions with similar temporal trajectories, a frequently encountered crucial task. We integrate on top of a baseline separable factor model with temporally dependent latent factors and spatially dependent factor loadings under a probit stick breaking process (PSBP) prior a new slice sampling algorithm that permits unknown varying numbers of spatial mixture components across all factors and guarantees them to be non-increasing through the MCMC iterations, thus considerably enhancing model flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. We further introduce a novel spatial latent nearest-neighbor Gaussian process (NNGP) prior and new sequential updating algorithms for the spatially varying latent variables in the PSBP prior, thereby attaining high spatial scalability. The markedly accelerated posterior sampling and spatial prediction as well as the great modeling and inferential performances of our models are substantiated by our simulation experiments.</p>
