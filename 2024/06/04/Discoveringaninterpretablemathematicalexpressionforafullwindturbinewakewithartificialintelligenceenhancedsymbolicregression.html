<meta name="description" content="The rapid expansion of wind power worldwide underscores the critical significance of engineering-focused analytical wake models in both the design and operation of wind farms. These theoretically-derived ana lytical wake models have limited predictive capabilities, particularly in the near-wake region close to the turbine rotor, due to assumptions that do not hold. Knowledge discovery methods can bridge these gaps by extracting insights, adjusting for theoretical assumptions, and developing accurate models for physical processes. In this study, we introduce a genetic symbolic regression (SR) algorithm to discover an interpretable mathematical expression for the mean velocity deficit throughout the wake, a previously unavailable insight. By incorporating a double Gaussian distribution into the SR algorithm as domain knowledge and designing a hierarchical equation structure, the search space is reduced, thus efficiently finding a concise, physically informed, and robust wake model. The proposed mathematical expression (equation) can predict the wake velocity deficit at any location in the full-wake region with high precision and stability.

  <p>The rapid expansion of wind power worldwide underscores the critical significance of engineering-focused analytical wake models in both the design and operation of wind farms. These theoretically-derived ana lytical wake models have limited predictive capabilities, particularly in the near-wake region close to the turbine rotor, due to assumptions that do not hold. Knowledge discovery methods can bridge these gaps by extracting insights, adjusting for theoretical assumptions, and developing accurate models for physical processes. In this study, we introduce a genetic symbolic regression (SR) algorithm to discover an interpretable mathematical expression for the mean velocity deficit throughout the wake, a previously unavailable insight. By incorporating a double Gaussian distribution into the SR algorithm as domain knowledge and designing a hierarchical equation structure, the search space is reduced, thus efficiently finding a concise, physically informed, and robust wake model. The proposed mathematical expression (equation) can predict the wake velocity deficit at any location in the full-wake region with high precision and stability. The model’s effectiveness and practicality are validated through experimental data and high-fidelity numerical simulations.</p>
