  <p>A hierarchical Bayesian approach that permits simultaneous inference for the regression coefficient matrix and the error precision (inverse covariance) matrix in the multivariate linear model is proposed. Assuming a natural ordering of the elements of the response, the precision matrix is reparameterized so it can be estimated with univariate-response linear regression techniques. A novel generalized bridge regression prior that accommodates both sparse and dense settings and is competitive with alternative methods for univariate-response regression is proposed and used in this framework. Two component-wise Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are developed for sampling, including a data augmentation algorithm based on a scale mixture of normals representation. Numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with comparable joint mean-covariance models, particularly in estimation of the precision matrix. The method is also used to estimate the 253 by 253 precision matrices of two classes of spectra extracted from images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Some interesting structural patterns in the estimates are discussed.</p>
