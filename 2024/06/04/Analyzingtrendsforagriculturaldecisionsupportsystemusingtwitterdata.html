  <p>The trends and reactions of the general public towards global events can be analyzed using data from social platforms, including Twitter. The number of tweets has been reported to help detect variations in communication traffic within subsets like countries, age groups and industries. Similarly, publicly accessible data and (in particular) data from social media about agricultural issues provide a great opportunity for obtaining instantaneous snapshots of farmer opinions and a method to track changes in opinion through temporal analysis. In this paper we hypothesize that the presence of keywords like precision agriculture, digital agriculture, Internet of Things (IoT), BigData, remote sensing, GPS, etc., in tweets could serve as an indicator of discussions centered around interest in modern farming practices. We extracted relevant tweets using keywords such as IoT, BigData and Geographical Information System (GIS), and then analyzed their geographical origin and frequency of their mention. We analyzed the Twitter data for the period of 1st -11th January 2018 to understand these trends and the factors affecting them. These factors, such as special events, projects, biogeography, etc., were further analyzed using tweet sources and trending hashtags from the database. The regions with the highest interest in the keywords were United States, Egypt, Brazil, Japan and China. A comparison of frequency of keywords revealed IoT as the most tweeted word (77.6%) in the downloaded data. The most used language was English followed by Spanish, Japanese and French.
