<meta name="description" content="Causal inference grows increasingly complex as the number of confounders increases. Given treatments $X$, confounders $Z$ and outcomes $Y$, we develop a non-parametric method to test the \textit{do-null} hypothesis $H_0:\; p(y \text{\it do}(X=x))=p(y)$ against the general alternative. Building on the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) for marginal independence testing, we propose backdoor-HSIC (bd-HSIC) and demonstrate that it is calibrated and has power for both binary and continuous treatments under a large number of confounders. Additionally, we establish convergence properties of the estimators of covariance operators used in bd-HSIC. We investigate the advantages and disadvantages of bd-HSIC against parametric tests as well as the importance of using the do-null testing in contrast to marginal independence testing or conditional independence testing.
