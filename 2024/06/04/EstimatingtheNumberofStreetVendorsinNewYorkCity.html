<meta name="description" content="We estimate the number of street vendors in New York City. We first summarize the process by which vendors receive licenses and permits to legally operate in New York City. We then describe a survey that was administered by the Street Vendor Project while distributing Coronavirus relief aid to vendors operating in New York City both with and without a license or permit. Finally, we calculate the total number of vendors using ratio estimation. We find that approximately 23,000 street vendors operate in New York City: 20,500 mobile food vendors and 2,300 general merchandise vendors. One third are located in just six ZIP Codes: 11368 (16%), 11372 (3%), and 11354 (3%) in North and West Queens and 10036 (5%), 10019 (4%), and 10001 (3%) in the Chelsea and Clinton neighborhoods of Manhattan. We also provide a theoretical justification of our estimates based on the theory of point processes and a discussion of their accuracy and implications. In particular, our estimates suggest the American Community Survey fails to cover the majority of New York City street vendors." />

  <h1>Estimating the Number of Street Vendors in New York City</h1>

  <br> [stat.AP]

  <p>We estimate the number of street vendors in New York City. We first summarize the process by which vendors receive licenses and permits to legally operate in New York City. We then describe a survey that was administered by the Street Vendor Project while distributing Coronavirus relief aid to vendors operating in New York City both with and without a license or permit. Finally, we calculate the total number of vendors using ratio estimation. We find that approximately 23,000 street vendors operate in New York City: 20,500 mobile food vendors and 2,300 general merchandise vendors. One third are located in just six ZIP Codes: 11368 (16%), 11372 (3%), and 11354 (3%) in North and West Queens and 10036 (5%), 10019 (4%), and 10001 (3%) in the Chelsea and Clinton neighborhoods of Manhattan. We also provide a theoretical justification of our estimates based on the theory of point processes and a discussion of their accuracy and implications. In particular, our estimates suggest the American Community Survey fails to cover the majority of New York City street vendors.</p>
