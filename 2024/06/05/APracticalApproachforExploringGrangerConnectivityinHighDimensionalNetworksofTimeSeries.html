<meta name="description" content="This manuscript presents a novel method for discovering effective connectivity between specified pairs of nodes in a high-dimensional network of time series. To accurately perform Granger causality analysis from the first node to the second node, it is essential to eliminate the influence of all other nodes within the network. The approach proposed is to create a low-dimensional representation of all other nodes in the network using frequency-domain-based dynamic principal component analysis (spectral DPCA). The resulting scores are subsequently removed from the first and second nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the high-dimensional network. To conduct hypothesis testing on Granger causality, we propose a permutation-based causality test. This test enhances the accuracy of our findings when the error structures are non-Gaussian. The approach has been validated in extensive simulation studies, which demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been demonstrated to be both expedient and viable on real datasets, with particular success observed on multichannel EEG networks." />

  <p>This manuscript presents a novel method for discovering effective connectivity between specified pairs of nodes in a high-dimensional network of time series. To accurately perform Granger causality analysis from the first node to the second node, it is essential to eliminate the influence of all other nodes within the network. The approach proposed is to create a low-dimensional representation of all other nodes in the network using frequency-domain-based dynamic principal component analysis (spectral DPCA). The resulting scores are subsequently removed from the first and second nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the high-dimensional network. To conduct hypothesis testing on Granger causality, we propose a permutation-based causality test. This test enhances the accuracy of our findings when the error structures are non-Gaussian. The approach has been validated in extensive simulation studies, which demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been demonstrated to be both expedient and viable on real datasets, with particular success observed on multichannel EEG networks.</p>
