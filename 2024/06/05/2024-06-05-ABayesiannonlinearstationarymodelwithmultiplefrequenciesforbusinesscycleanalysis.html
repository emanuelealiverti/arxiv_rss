<p>We design a novel, nonlinear single-source-of-error model for analysis of multiple business cycles. The modelâ€™s specification is intended to capture key empirical characteristics of business cycle data by allowing for simultaneous cycles of different types and lengths, as well as time-variable amplitude and phase shift. The model is shown to feature relevant theoretical properties, including stationarity and pseudo-cyclical autocovariance function, and enables a decomposition of overall cyclic fluctuations into separate frequency-specific components. We develop a Bayesian framework for estimation and inference in the model, along with an MCMC procedure for posterior sampling, combining the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, suitably adapted to address encountered numerical issues. Empirical results obtained from the model applied to the Polish GDP growth rates imply co-existence of two types of economic fluctuations: the investment and inventory cycles, and support the stochastic variability of the amplitude and phase shift, also capturing some business cycle asymmetries. Finally, the Bayesian framework enables a fully probabilistic inference on the business cycle clocks and dating, which seems the most relevant approach in view of economic uncertainties.</p>
