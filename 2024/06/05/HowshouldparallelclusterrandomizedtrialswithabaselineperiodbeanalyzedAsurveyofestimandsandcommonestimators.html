  <p>The parallel cluster randomized trial with baseline (PB-CRT) is a common variant of the standard parallel cluster randomized trial (P-CRT) that maintains parallel randomization but additionally allows for both within and between-cluster comparisons. We define two estimands of interest in the context of PB-CRTs, the participant-average treatment effect (pATE) and cluster-average treatment effect (cATE), to address participant and cluster-level hypotheses. Previous work has indicated that under informative cluster sizes, commonly used mixed-effects models may yield inconsistent estimators for the estimands of interest. In this work, we theoretically derive the convergence of the unweighted and inverse cluster-period size weighted (i.) independence estimating equation, (ii.) fixed-effects model, (iii.) exchangeable mixed-effects model, and (iv.) nested-exchangeable mixed-effects model treatment effect estimators in a PB-CRT with continuous outcomes. We report a simulation study to evaluate the bias and inference with these different treatment effect estimators and their corresponding model-based or jackknife variance estimators. We then re-analyze a PB-CRT examining the effects of community youth teams on improving mental health among adolescent girls in rural eastern India. We demonstrate that the unweighted and weighted independence estimating equation and fixed-effects model regularly yield consistent estimators for the pATE and cATE estimands, whereas the mixed-effects models yield inconsistent estimators under informative cluster sizes. However, we demonstrate that unlike the nested-exchangeable mixed-effects model and corresponding analyses in P-CRTs, the exchangeable mixed-effects model is surprisingly robust to bias in many PB-CRT scenarios.</p>
