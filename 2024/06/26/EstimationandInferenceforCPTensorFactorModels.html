  <p>High-dimensional tensor-valued data have recently gained attention from researchers in economics and finance. We consider the estimation and inference of high-dimensional tensor factor models, where each dimension of the tensor diverges. Our focus is on a factor model that admits CP-type tensor decomposition, which allows for non-orthogonal loading vectors. Based on the contemporary covariance matrix, we propose an iterative simultaneous projection estimation method. Our estimator is robust to weak dependence among factors and weak correlation across different dimensions in the idiosyncratic shocks. We establish an inferential theory, demonstrating both consistency and asymptotic normality under relaxed assumptions. Within a unified framework, we consider two eigenvalue ratio-based estimators for the number of factors in a tensor factor model and justify their consistency. Through a simulation study and two empirical applications featuring sorted portfolios and international trade flows, we illustrate the advantages of our proposed estimator over existing methodologies in the literature.</p>
