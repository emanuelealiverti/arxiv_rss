  <p>When samples that each cover part of a population for a certain reference date become available slowly over time, an estimate of the population size can be obtained when at least two samples are available. Ideally one uses all the available samples, but if some samples become available much later one may want to use the samples that are available earlier, to obtain a preliminary or nowcast estimate. However, a limited number of samples may no longer lead to asymptotically unbiased estimates, in particularly in case of two early available samples that suffer from pairwise dependence. In this paper we propose a multiple system nowcasting model that deals with this issue by combining the early available samples with samples from a previous reference date and the expectation-maximisation algorithm. This leads to a nowcast estimate that is asymptotically unbiased under more relaxed assumptions than the dual-system estimator. The multiple system nowcasting model is applied to the problem of estimating the number of homeless people in The Netherlands, which leads to reasonably accurate nowcast estimates.</p>
