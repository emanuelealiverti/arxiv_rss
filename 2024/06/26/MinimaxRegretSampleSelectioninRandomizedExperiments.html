  <p>Randomized controlled trials are often run in settings with many subpopulations that may have differential benefits from the treatment being evaluated. We consider the problem of sample selection, i.e., whom to enroll in a randomized trial, such as to optimize welfare in a heterogeneous population. We formalize this problem within the minimax-regret framework, and derive optimal sample-selection schemes under a variety of conditions. Using data from a COVID-19 vaccine trial, we also highlight how different objectives and decision rules can lead to meaningfully different guidance regarding optimal sample allocation.</p>
