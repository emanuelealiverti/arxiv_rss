When evaluating models on the opposite dataset, AUROC and concordance values drop by 0.1-0.15, which may be due to cohort differences. All code and results are made public." />

  <p>Several recent high-impact studies leverage large hospital-owned electrocardiographic (ECG) databases to model and predict patient mortality. MIMIC-IV, released September 2023, is the first comparable public dataset and includes 800,000 ECGs from a U.S. hospital system. Previously, the largest public ECG dataset was Code-15, containing 345,000 ECGs collected during routine care in Brazil. These datasets now provide an excellent resource for a broader audience to explore ECG survival modeling. Here, we benchmark survival model performance on Code-15 and MIMIC-IV with two neural network architectures, compare four deep survival modeling approaches to Cox regressions trained on classifier outputs, and evaluate performance at one to ten years. Our results yield AUROC and concordance scores comparable to past work (circa 0.8) and reasonable AUPRC scores (MIMIC-IV: 0.4-0.5, Code-15: 0.05-0.13) considering the fraction of ECG samples linked to a mortality (MIMIC-IV: 27\%, Code-15: 4\%).
