  <p>This paper introduces and reviews some of the principles and methods used in Bayesian reliability. It specifically discusses methods used in the analysis of success/no-success data and then reminds the reader of a simple Monte Carlo algorithm that can be used to calculate the posterior distribution of a system’s reliability. This algorithm is especially useful when a system’s reliability is modeled through the reliability of its subcomponents, yet only system-level data is available.</p>
