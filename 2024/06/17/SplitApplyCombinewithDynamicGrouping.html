  <p>Partitioning a data set by one or more of its attributes and computing an aggregate for each part is one of the most common operations in data analyses. There are use cases where the partitioning is determined dynamically by collapsing smaller subsets into larger ones, to ensure sufficient support for the computed aggregate. These use cases are not supported by software implementing split-apply-combine types of operations. This paper presents the \texttt{R} package \texttt{accumulate} that offers convenient interfaces for defining grouped aggregation where the grouping itself is dynamically determined, based on user-defined conditions on subsets, and a user-defined subset collapsing scheme. The formal underlying algorithm is described and analyzed as well.</p>
