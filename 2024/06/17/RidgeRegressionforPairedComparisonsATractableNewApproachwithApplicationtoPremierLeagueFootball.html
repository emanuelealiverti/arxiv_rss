  <p>Paired comparison models, such as Bradley-Terry and Thurstone-Mosteller, are commonly used to estimate relative strengths of pairwise compared items in tournament-style datasets. With predictive performance as primary criterion, we discuss estimation of paired comparison models with a ridge penalty. A new approach is derived which combines empirical Bayes and composite likelihoods without any need to re-fit the model, as a convenient alternative to cross-validation of the ridge tuning parameter. Simulation studies, together with application to 28 seasons of English Premier League football, demonstrate much better predictive accuracy of the new approach relative to ordinary maximum likelihood. While the application of a standard bias-reducing penalty was found to improve appreciably the performance of maximum likelihood, the ridge penalty with tuning as developed here yields greater accuracy still.</p>
