For these, we propose a flexible modelling technique, based on generalised additive models, with diagnostics indicating generally good performance for the observed data. Challenges C3 and C4 concern multivariate problems where the focus is on estimating joint extremal probabilities. For challenge C3, we propose an extension of available models in the multivariate literature and use this framework to estimate extreme probabilities in the presence of non-stationary dependence. Finally, for challenge C4, which concerns a 50 dimensional random vector, we employ a clustering technique to achieve dimension reduction and use a conditional modelling approach to estimate extremal probabilities across independent groups of variables." />
