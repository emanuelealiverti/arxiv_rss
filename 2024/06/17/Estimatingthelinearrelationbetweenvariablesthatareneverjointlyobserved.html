  <p>This work is motivated by in vivo experiments in which measurement are destructive so that the variables of interest can never be observed simultaneously when the aim is to estimate the regression coefficients of a linear regression. Assuming that the global experiment can be decomposed into sub experiments (corresponding for example to different doses) with distinct first moments, we propose different estimators of the linear regression which take account of that additional information. We consider estimators based on moments as well as estimators based optimal transport theory. These estimators are proved to be consistent as well as asymptotically Gaussian under weak hypotheses. The asymptotic variance has no explicit expression, except in some particular cases, and specific bootstrap approaches are developed to build confidence intervals for the estimated parameter. A Monte Carlo study is conducted to assess and compare the finite sample performances of the different approaches.</p>
