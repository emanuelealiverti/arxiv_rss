  <p>Traditional inference in relational event models from dynamic network data involves only dyadic and node-specific variables, as anything that is global, i.e. constant across dyads, drops out of the partial likelihood. We address this with the use of nested case-control sampling on a time-shifted version of the event process. This leads to a partial likelihood of a degenerate logistic additive model, enabling efficient estimation of global and non-global covariate effects. The method’s effectiveness is demonstrated through a simulation study. An application to bike sharing data reveals significant influences of global covariates like weather and time of day on bike-sharing dynamics.</p>
