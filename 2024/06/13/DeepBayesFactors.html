  <p>The is no other model or hypothesis verification tool in Bayesian statistics that is as widely used as the Bayes factor. We focus on generative models that are likelihood-free and, therefore, render the computation of Bayes factors (marginal likelihood ratios) far from obvious. We propose a deep learning estimator of the Bayes factor based on simulated data from two competing models using the likelihood ratio trick. This estimator is devoid of summary statistics and obviates some of the difficulties with ABC model choice. We establish sufficient conditions for consistency of our Deep Bayes Factor estimator as well as its consistency as a model selection tool.
