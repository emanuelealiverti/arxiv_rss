  <p>Multivariate Item Response Theory (MIRT) is sought-after widely by applied researchers looking for interpretable (sparse) explanations underlying response patterns in questionnaire data.

Our paper develops a Bayesian platform for binary and ordinal item MIRT which requires minimal tuning and scales well on large datasets due to its parallelizable features. Bayesian methodology for MIRT models has traditionally relied on MCMC simulation, which cannot only be slow in practice, but also often renders exact sparsity recovery impossible without additional thresholding. In this work, we develop a scalable Bayesian EM algorithm to estimate sparse factor loadings from mixed continuous, binary, and ordinal item responses. We address the seemingly insurmountable problem of unknown latent factor dimensionality with tools from Bayesian nonparametrics which enable estimating the number of factors. Rotations to sparsity through parameter expansion further enhance convergence and interpretability without identifiability constraints. In our simulation study, we show that our method reliably recovers both the factor dimensionality as well as the latent structure on high-dimensional synthetic data even for small samples.
