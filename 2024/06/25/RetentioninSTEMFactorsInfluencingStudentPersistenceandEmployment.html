<meta name="description" content="This study utilizes data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study to explore factors associated with the likelihood of students’ employment in STEM fields one year after graduation. We examined various factors related to students’ individual characteristics (e.g., gender, race, and financial situation), institutional experiences (e.g., major, academic standing, research involvement, internships, extracurricular activities, and undergraduate practicum), and institutional and national trends. The results indicate lower STEM employment likelihood for minority groups and students with academic probation. The findings also highlight the positive impact of undergraduate practicum and job relevance to major on STEM employment likelihood. On the contrary, career services were negatively associated with the likelihood of students’ STEM occupation choice, suggesting potential shortcomings in STEM job preparation within these services. The study provides valuable insights and actionable recommendations for policymakers and educators seeking to increase diversity and inclusion in STEM fields, suggesting the need for more efficient and tailored educational interventions and curriculum development." />

  <p>This study utilizes data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study to explore factors associated with the likelihood of students’ employment in STEM fields one year after graduation. We examined various factors related to students’ individual characteristics (e.g., gender, race, and financial situation), institutional experiences (e.g., major, academic standing, research involvement, internships, extracurricular activities, and undergraduate practicum), and institutional and national trends. The results indicate lower STEM employment likelihood for minority groups and students with academic probation. The findings also highlight the positive impact of undergraduate practicum and job relevance to major on STEM employment likelihood. On the contrary, career services were negatively associated with the likelihood of students’ STEM occupation choice, suggesting potential shortcomings in STEM job preparation within these services. The study provides valuable insights and actionable recommendations for policymakers and educators seeking to increase diversity and inclusion in STEM fields, suggesting the need for more efficient and tailored educational interventions and curriculum development.</p>
