  <p>In the last two decades, considerable research has been devoted to a phenomenon known as spatial confounding. Spatial confounding is thought to occur when there is multicollinearity between a covariate and the random effect in a spatial regression model. This multicollinearity is considered highly problematic when the inferential goal is estimating regression coefficients and various methodologies have been proposed to attempt to alleviate it. Recently, it has become apparent that many of these methodologies are flawed, yet the field continues to expand. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective of synthesizing the work in the field of spatial confounding. We propose that at least two distinct phenomena are currently conflated with the term spatial confounding. We refer to these as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">analysis model'' and the</code>data generation’’ types of spatial confounding. We show that these two issues can lead to contradicting conclusions about whether spatial confounding exists and whether methods to alleviate it will improve inference. Our results also illustrate that in most cases, traditional spatial linear mixed models do help to improve inference on regression coefficients. Drawing on the insights gained, we offer a path forward for research in spatial confounding.</p>
