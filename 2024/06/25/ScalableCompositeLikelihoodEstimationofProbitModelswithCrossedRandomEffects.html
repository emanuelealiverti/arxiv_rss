<meta name="description" content="Crossed random effects structures arise in many scientific contexts. They raise severe computational problems with likelihood computations scaling like $N^{3/2}$ or worse for $N$ data points. In this paper we develop a new composite likelihood approach for crossed random effects probit models. For data arranged in R rows and C columns, the likelihood function includes a very difficult R + C dimensional integral. The composite likelihood we develop uses the marginal distribution of the response along with two hierarchical models. The cost is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and it can be computed with $R + C$ one dimensional integrals. We find that the commonly used Laplace approximation has a cost that grows superlinearly. We get consistent estimates of the probit slope and variance components from our composite likelihood algorithm. We also show how to estimate the covariance of the estimated regression coefficients. The algorithm scales readily to a data set of five million observations from Stitch Fix with $R + C &gt; 700{,}000$." />

  <p>Crossed random effects structures arise in many scientific contexts. They raise severe computational problems with likelihood computations scaling like $N^{3/2}$ or worse for $N$ data points. In this paper we develop a new composite likelihood approach for crossed random effects probit models. For data arranged in R rows and C columns, the likelihood function includes a very difficult R + C dimensional integral. The composite likelihood we develop uses the marginal distribution of the response along with two hierarchical models. The cost is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and it can be computed with $R + C$ one dimensional integrals. We find that the commonly used Laplace approximation has a cost that grows superlinearly. We get consistent estimates of the probit slope and variance components from our composite likelihood algorithm. We also show how to estimate the covariance of the estimated regression coefficients. The algorithm scales readily to a data set of five million observations from Stitch Fix with $R + C &gt; 700{,}000$.</p>
