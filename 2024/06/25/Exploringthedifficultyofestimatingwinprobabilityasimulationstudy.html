<meta name="description" content="Estimating win probability is one of the classic modeling tasks of sports analytics. Many widely used win probability estimators are statistical win probability models, which fit the relationship between a binary win/loss outcome variable and certain game-state variables using data-driven regression or machine learning approaches. To illustrate just how difficult it is to accurately fit a statistical win probability model from noisy and highly correlated observational data, in this paper we conduct a simulation study. We create a simplified random walk version of football in which true win probability at each game-state is known, and we see how well a model recovers it. We find that the dependence structure of observational play-by-play data substantially inflates the bias and variance of estimators and lowers the effective sample size. This makes it essential to quantify uncertainty in win probability estimates, but typical bootstrapped confidence intervals are too narrow and don’t achieve nominal coverage. Hence, we introduce a novel method, the fractional bootstrap, to calibrate these intervals to achieve adequate coverage." />

  <p>Estimating win probability is one of the classic modeling tasks of sports analytics. Many widely used win probability estimators are statistical win probability models, which fit the relationship between a binary win/loss outcome variable and certain game-state variables using data-driven regression or machine learning approaches. To illustrate just how difficult it is to accurately fit a statistical win probability model from noisy and highly correlated observational data, in this paper we conduct a simulation study. We create a simplified random walk version of football in which true win probability at each game-state is known, and we see how well a model recovers it. We find that the dependence structure of observational play-by-play data substantially inflates the bias and variance of estimators and lowers the effective sample size. This makes it essential to quantify uncertainty in win probability estimates, but typical bootstrapped confidence intervals are too narrow and don’t achieve nominal coverage. Hence, we introduce a novel method, the fractional bootstrap, to calibrate these intervals to achieve adequate coverage.</p>
