  <p>We consider a covariate-assisted ranking model grounded in the Plackett–Luce framework. Unlike existing works focusing on pure covariates or individual effects with fixed covariates, our approach integrates individual effects with dynamic covariates. This added flexibility enhances realistic ranking yet poses significant challenges for analyzing the associated estimation procedures. This paper makes an initial attempt to address these challenges. We begin by discussing the sufficient and necessary condition for the model’s identifiability. We then introduce an efficient alternating maximization algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Under suitable assumptions on the topology of comparison graphs and dynamic covariates, we establish a quantitative uniform consistency result for the MLE with convergence rates characterized by the asymptotic graph connectivity. The proposed graph topology assumption holds for several popular random graph models under optimal leading-order sparsity conditions. A comprehensive numerical study is conducted to corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the application of the proposed model to real-world datasets, including horse racing and tennis competitions.</p>
