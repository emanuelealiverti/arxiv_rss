The proposed framework consists of learnable prior distributions for low-dimensional graph representations and of a decoder that can generate graphs from the latent representations. The informative prior distributions in the latent spaces are learned from the observed data as empirical Bayes, and the expressive power of generative model is exploited to assist multiple change point detection.

  <p>This paper proposes a generative model to detect change points in time series of graphs. The proposed framework consists of learnable prior distributions for low-dimensional graph representations and of a decoder that can generate graphs from the latent representations. The informative prior distributions in the latent spaces are learned from the observed data as empirical Bayes, and the expressive power of generative model is exploited to assist multiple change point detection. Specifically, the model parameters are learned via maximum approximate likelihood, with a Group Fused Lasso regularization on the prior parameters. The optimization problem is then solved via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), and Langevin Dynamics are recruited for posterior inference. Experiments in both simulated and real data demonstrate the ability of the generative model in supporting change point detection with good performance.</p>
