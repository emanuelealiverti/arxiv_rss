  <p>In this work, we propose the joint linked component analysis (joint_LCA) for multiview data. Unlike classic methods which extract the shared components in a sequential manner, the objective of joint_LCA is to identify the view-specific loading matrices and the rank of the common latent subspace simultaneously. We formulate a matrix decomposition model where a joint structure and an individual structure are present in each data view, which enables us to arrive at a clean svd representation for the cross covariance between any pair of data views. An objective function with a novel penalty term is then proposed to achieve simultaneous estimation and rank selection. In addition, a refitting procedure is employed as a remedy to reduce the shrinkage bias caused by the penalization.</p>
