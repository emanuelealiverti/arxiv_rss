  <p>The problem of computing an exact experimental design that is optimal for the least-squares estimation of the parameters of a regression model is considered. We show that this problem can be solved via mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for a wide class of optimality criteria, including the criteria of A-, I-, G- and MV-optimality. This approach improves upon the current state-of-the-art mathematical programming formulation, which uses mixed-integer second-order cone programming. The key idea underlying the MILP formulation is McCormick relaxation, which critically depends on finite interval bounds for the elements of the covariance matrix of the least-squares estimator corresponding to an optimal exact design. We provide both analytic and algorithmic methods for constructing these bounds. We also demonstrate the unique advantages of the MILP approach, such as the possibility of incorporating multiple design constraints into the optimization problem, including constraints on the variances and covariances of the least-squares estimator.</p>
