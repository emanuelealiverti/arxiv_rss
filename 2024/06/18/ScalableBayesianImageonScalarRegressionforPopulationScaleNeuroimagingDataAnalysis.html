Our approach uniquely enables direct spatial posterior inferences on brain activation regions. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through simulations and analysis of the UK Biobank task fMRI data, encompassing 38,639 subjects and over 120,000 voxels per image, showing that it can achieve a speed increase of 4 to 11 times and enhance statistical power by 8% to 18% compared to traditional Gibbs sampling with zero-imputation in various simulation scenarios." />
