  <p>We consider a recently proposed class of MCMC methods which uses proximity maps instead of gradients to build proposal mechanisms which can be employed for both differentiable and non-differentiable targets. These methods have been shown to be stable for a wide class of targets, making them a valuable alternative to Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithms (MALA); and have found wide application in imaging contexts. The wider stability properties are obtained by building the Moreau-Yosida envelope for the target of interest, which depends on a parameter $\lambda$. In this work, we investigate the optimal scaling problem for this class of algorithms, which encompasses MALA, and provide practical guidelines for the implementation of these methods.</p>
