To evaluate updates of recommender systems targeting content creators, platforms frequently engage in creator-side randomized experiments to estimate treatment effect, defined as the difference in outcomes when a new (vs. the status quo) algorithm is deployed on the platform.

This bias arises because of recommender interference, which occurs when treated and control creators compete for exposure through the recommender system. We propose a “recommender choice model” that captures how an item is chosen among a pool comprised of both treated and control content items. By combining a structural choice model with neural networks, the framework directly models the interference pathway in a microfounded way while accounting for rich viewer-content heterogeneity. Using the model, we construct a double/debiased estimator of the treatment effect that is consistent and asymptotically normal. We demonstrate its empirical performance with a field experiment on Weixin short-video platform: besides the standard creator-side experiment, we carry out a costly blocked double-sided randomization design to obtain a benchmark estimate without interference bias.

  <p>Recommender systems are essential for content-sharing platforms by curating personalized content. To evaluate updates of recommender systems targeting content creators, platforms frequently engage in creator-side randomized experiments to estimate treatment effect, defined as the difference in outcomes when a new (vs. the status quo) algorithm is deployed on the platform. We show that the standard difference-in-means estimator can lead to a biased treatment effect estimate. This bias arises because of recommender interference, which occurs when treated and control creators compete for exposure through the recommender system. We propose a “recommender choice model” that captures how an item is chosen among a pool comprised of both treated and control content items. By combining a structural choice model with neural networks, the framework directly models the interference pathway in a microfounded way while accounting for rich viewer-content heterogeneity. Using the model, we construct a double/debiased estimator of the treatment effect that is consistent and asymptotically normal. We demonstrate its empirical performance with a field experiment on Weixin short-video platform: besides the standard creator-side experiment, we carry out a costly blocked double-sided randomization design to obtain a benchmark estimate without interference bias. We show that the proposed estimator significantly reduces the bias in treatment effect estimates compared to the standard difference-in-means estimator.</p>
