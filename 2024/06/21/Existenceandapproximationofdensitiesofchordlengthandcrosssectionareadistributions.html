  <br> [stat.AP]

  <p>In various stereological problems an $n$-dimensional convex body is intersected with an $(n-1)$-dimensional Isotropic Uniformly Random (IUR) hyperplane. In this paper the cumulative distribution function associated with the $(n-1)$-dimensional volume of such a random section is studied. This distribution is also known as chord length distribution and cross section area distribution in the planar and spatial case respectively. For various classes of convex bodies it is shown that these distribution functions are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. A Monte Carlo simulation scheme is proposed for approximating the corresponding probability density functions.</p>
