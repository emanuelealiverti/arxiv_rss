  <p>We propose an Embedding Network Autoregressive Model (ENAR) for multivariate networked longitudinal data. We assume the network is generated from a latent variable model, and these unobserved variables are included in a structural peer effect model or a time series network autoregressive model as additive effects. This approach takes a unified view of two related problems, (1) modeling and predicting multivariate time series data and (2) causal peer influence estimation in the presence of homophily from finite time longitudinal data. Our estimation strategy comprises estimating latent factors from the observed network adjacency matrix either through spectral embedding or maximum likelihood estimation, followed by least squares estimation of the network autoregressive model. We show that the estimated momentum and peer effect parameters are consistent and asymptotically normal in asymptotic setups with a growing number of network vertices N while including a growing number of time points T and finite T cases. We allow the number of latent vectors K to grow at appropriate rates, which improves upon existing rates when such results are available for related models.</p>
