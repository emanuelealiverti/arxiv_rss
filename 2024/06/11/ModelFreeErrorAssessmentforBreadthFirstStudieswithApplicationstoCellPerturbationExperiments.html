<meta name="description" content="With the advent of high-throughput screenings, it has become increasingly common for studies to devote limited resources to estimating many parameters imprecisely rather than to estimating a few parameters well. In these studies, only two or three independent replicates measure each parameter, and therefore it is challenging to assess the variance of these measurements. One solution is to pool variance estimates across different parameters using a parametric model of estimator error. However, such models are difficult to specify correctly, especially in the presence of ``batch effects.’’ In this paper, we propose new model-free methods for assessing and controlling estimator error. Our focus is on type S error, which is of particular importance in many settings. To produce tight confidence intervals without making unrealistic assumptions, we improve on Hoeffding’s bounds for sums of bounded random variables and obtain the tightest possible Chernoff-Cram&#39;er bound. Our methods compare favorably with existing practice for high-throughput screenings, such as methods based on the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Existing practices fail to control error at the nominal level in some cases and are needlessly conservative in others." />

  <p>With the advent of high-throughput screenings, it has become increasingly common for studies to devote limited resources to estimating many parameters imprecisely rather than to estimating a few parameters well. In these studies, only two or three independent replicates measure each parameter, and therefore it is challenging to assess the variance of these measurements. One solution is to pool variance estimates across different parameters using a parametric model of estimator error. However, such models are difficult to specify correctly, especially in the presence of ``batch effects.’’ In this paper, we propose new model-free methods for assessing and controlling estimator error. Our focus is on type S error, which is of particular importance in many settings. To produce tight confidence intervals without making unrealistic assumptions, we improve on Hoeffding’s bounds for sums of bounded random variables and obtain the tightest possible Chernoff-Cram'er bound. Our methods compare favorably with existing practice for high-throughput screenings, such as methods based on the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Existing practices fail to control error at the nominal level in some cases and are needlessly conservative in others.</p>
