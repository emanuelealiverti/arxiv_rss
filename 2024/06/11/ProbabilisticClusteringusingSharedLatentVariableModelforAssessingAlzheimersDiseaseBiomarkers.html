  <p>The preclinical stage of many neurodegenerative diseases can span decades before symptoms become apparent. Understanding the sequence of preclinical biomarker changes provides a critical opportunity for early diagnosis and effective intervention prior to significant loss of patients’ brain functions. The main challenge to early detection lies in the absence of direct observation of the disease state and the considerable variability in both biomarkers and disease dynamics among individuals.
