  <p>Modeling item parameters as a function of item characteristics has a long history but has generally focused on models for item location. Explanatory item response models for item discrimination are available but rarely used. In this study, we extend existing approaches for modeling item discrimination from dichotomous to polytomous item responses. We illustrate our proposed approach with an application to four social-emotional learning surveys of preschool children to investigate how item discrimination depends on whether an item is positively or negatively framed. Negative framing predicts significantly lower item discrimination on two of the four surveys, and a plausibly causal estimate from a regression discontinuity analysis shows that negative framing reduces discrimination by about 30\% on one survey. We conclude with a discussion of potential applications of explanatory models for item discrimination.</p>
