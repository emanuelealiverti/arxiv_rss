<meta name="description" content="Comparing and evaluating small area estimation (SAE) models for a given application is inherently difficult. Typically, many areas lack enough data to check unit-level modeling assumptions or to assess unit-level predictions empirically; and no ground truth is available for checking area-level estimates. Design-based simulation from artificial populations can help with each of these issues, but only if the artificial populations realistically represent the application at hand and are not built using assumptions that inherently favor one SAE model over another. In this paper, we borrow ideas from random hot deck, approximate Bayesian bootstrap (ABB), and k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) imputation methods to propose a kNN-based approximation to ABB (KBAABB), for generating an artificial population when rich unit-level auxiliary data is available. We introduce diagnostic checks on the process of building the artificial population, and we demonstrate how to use such an artificial population for design-based simulation studies to compare and evaluate SAE models, using real data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Forest Service." />

  <p>Comparing and evaluating small area estimation (SAE) models for a given application is inherently difficult. Typically, many areas lack enough data to check unit-level modeling assumptions or to assess unit-level predictions empirically; and no ground truth is available for checking area-level estimates. Design-based simulation from artificial populations can help with each of these issues, but only if the artificial populations realistically represent the application at hand and are not built using assumptions that inherently favor one SAE model over another. In this paper, we borrow ideas from random hot deck, approximate Bayesian bootstrap (ABB), and k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) imputation methods to propose a kNN-based approximation to ABB (KBAABB), for generating an artificial population when rich unit-level auxiliary data is available. We introduce diagnostic checks on the process of building the artificial population, and we demonstrate how to use such an artificial population for design-based simulation studies to compare and evaluate SAE models, using real data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Forest Service.</p>
