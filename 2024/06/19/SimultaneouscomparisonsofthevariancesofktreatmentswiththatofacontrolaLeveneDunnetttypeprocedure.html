  <p>There are some global tests for heterogeneity of variance in k-sample one-way layouts, but few consider pairwise comparisons between treatment levels. For experimental designs with a control, comparisons of the variances between the treatment levels and the control are of interest - in analogy to the location parameter with the Dunnett (1955) procedure. Such a many-to-one approach for variances is proposed using the Levene transformation, a kind of residuals. Its properties are characterized with simulation studies and corresponding data examples are evaluated with R code.</p>
