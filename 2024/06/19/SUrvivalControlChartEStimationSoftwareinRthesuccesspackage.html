Control charts are widely used for this purpose, but often lack the possibility to monitor survival outcomes. Recently, inspecting survival outcomes has become of interest, especially in medical settings where outcomes often depend on risk factors of patients. For this reason many new survival control charts have been devised and existing ones have been extended to incorporate survival outcomes. The R package success allows users to construct risk-adjusted control charts for survival data. Functions to determine control chart parameters are included, which can be used even without expert knowledge on the subject of control charts.

  <p>Monitoring the quality of statistical processes has been of great importance, mostly in industrial applications.

For this reason many new survival control charts have been devised and existing ones have been extended to incorporate survival outcomes. The R package success allows users to construct risk-adjusted control charts for survival data.
