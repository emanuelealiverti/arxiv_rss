  <p>While within a clinical study there may be multiple doses and endpoints, across different studies each study will result in either an approval or a lack of approval of the drug compound studied. The term False Approval Rate (FAR) is the term this paper utilizes to represent the proportion of drug compounds that lack efficacy incorrectly approved by regulators. (In the U.S., compounds that have efficacy and are approved are not involved in the FAR consideration, according to our reading of the relevant U.S. Congressional statute).
  While Tukey’s (1953) Error Rate Familywise (ERFw) is meant to be applied within a clinical study, Tukey’s (1953) Error Rate per Family (ERpF), defined along-side ERFw, is meant to be applied across studies. We show that controlling Error Rate Familywise (ERFw) within a clinical study at 5% in turn controls Error Rate per Family (ERpF) across studies at 5-per-100, regardless of whether the studies are correlated or not. Further, we show that ongoing regulatory practice, the additive multiplicity adjustment method of controlling ERpF, is controlling False Approval Rate (FAR) exactly (not conservatively) at 5-per-100 (even for Platform trials).
  In contrast, if a regulatory agency chooses to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) across studies at 5% instead, then this change in policy from ERpF control to FDR control will result in incorrectly approving drug compounds that lack efficacy at a rate higher than 5-per-100, because in essence it gives the industry additional rewards for successfully developing compounds that have efficacy and are approved.
