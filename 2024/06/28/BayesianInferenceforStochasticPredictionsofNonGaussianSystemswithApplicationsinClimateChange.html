  <p>Climate change poses significant challenges for accurate climate modeling due to the complexity and variability of non-Gaussian climate systems. To address the complexities of non-Gaussian systems in climate modeling, this thesis proposes a Bayesian framework utilizing the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), and Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) for one-dimensional and two-dimensional stochastic climate models, evaluated with real-world temperature and sea level data. We study these methods under varying conditions, including measurement noise, sample sizes, and observed and hidden variables, to highlight their respective advantages and limitations. Our findings reveal that merely increasing data is insufficient for accurate predictions; instead, selecting appropriate methods is crucial. This research provides insights into issues related to information barrier, curse of dimensionality, prediction variability, and measurement noise quantification, thereby enhancing the application of these techniques in real-world climate scenarios.</p>
