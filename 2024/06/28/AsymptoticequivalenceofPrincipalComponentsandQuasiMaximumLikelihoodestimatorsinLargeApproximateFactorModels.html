  <p>This paper investigates the properties of Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimation of an approximate factor model for an $n$-dimensional vector of stationary time series. We prove that the factor loadings estimated by Quasi Maximum Likelihood are asymptotically equivalent, as $n\to\infty$, to those estimated via Principal Components. Both estimators are, in turn, also asymptotically equivalent, as $n\to\infty$, to the unfeasible Ordinary Least Squares estimator we would have if the factors were observed. We also show that the usual sandwich form of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the simpler asymptotic covariance matrix of the unfeasible Ordinary Least Squares. All these results hold in the general case in which the idiosyncratic components are cross-sectionally heteroskedastic, as well as serially and cross-sectionally weakly correlated. The intuition behind these results is that as $n\to\infty$ the factors can be considered as observed, thus showing that factor models enjoy a blessing of dimensionality.</p>
