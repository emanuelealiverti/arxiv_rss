<meta name="description" content="In an observational study, matching aims to create many small sets of similar treated and control units from initial samples that may differ substantially in order to permit more credible causal inferences. The problem of constructing matched sets may be formulated as an optimization problem, but it can be challenging to specify a single objective function that adequately captures all the design considerations at work. One solution, proposed by \citet{pimentel2019optimal} is to explore a family of matched designs that are Pareto optimal for multiple objective functions. We present an R package, \href{https://github.com/ShichaoHan/MultiObjMatch}{\texttt{MultiObjMatch}}, that implements this multi-objective matching strategy using a network flow algorithm for several common design goals: marginal balance on important covariates, size of the matched sample, and average within-pair multivariate distances. We demonstrate the package’s flexibility in exploring user-defined tradeoffs of interest via two case studies, a reanalysis of the canonical National Supported Work dataset and a novel analysis of a clinical dataset to estimate the impact of diabetic kidney disease on hospitalization costs." />

  <p>In an observational study, matching aims to create many small sets of similar treated and control units from initial samples that may differ substantially in order to permit more credible causal inferences. The problem of constructing matched sets may be formulated as an optimization problem, but it can be challenging to specify a single objective function that adequately captures all the design considerations at work. One solution, proposed by \citet{pimentel2019optimal} is to explore a family of matched designs that are Pareto optimal for multiple objective functions. We present an R package, \href{https://github.com/ShichaoHan/MultiObjMatch}{\texttt{MultiObjMatch}}, that implements this multi-objective matching strategy using a network flow algorithm for several common design goals: marginal balance on important covariates, size of the matched sample, and average within-pair multivariate distances. We demonstrate the package’s flexibility in exploring user-defined tradeoffs of interest via two case studies, a reanalysis of the canonical National Supported Work dataset and a novel analysis of a clinical dataset to estimate the impact of diabetic kidney disease on hospitalization costs.</p>
