<meta name="description" content="Case-control sampling is a commonly used retrospective sampling design to alleviate imbalanced structure of binary data. When fitting the logistic regression model with case-control data, although the slope parameter of the model can be consistently estimated, the intercept parameter is not identifiable, and the marginal case proportion is not estimatable, either. We consider the situations in which besides the case-control data from the main study, called internal study, there also exists summary-level information from related external studies. An empirical likelihood based approach is proposed to make inference for the logistic model by incorporating the internal case-control data and external information. We show that the intercept parameter is identifiable with the help of external information, and then all the regression parameters as well as the marginal case proportion can be estimated consistently. The proposed method also accounts for the possible variability in external studies. The resultant estimators are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed. The asymptotic variance-covariance matrix can be consistently estimated by the case-control data. The optimal way to utilized external information is discussed.

  <p>Case-control sampling is a commonly used retrospective sampling design to alleviate imbalanced structure of binary data. When fitting the logistic regression model with case-control data, although the slope parameter of the model can be consistently estimated, the intercept parameter is not identifiable, and the marginal case proportion is not estimatable, either. We consider the situations in which besides the case-control data from the main study, called internal study, there also exists summary-level information from related external studies. An empirical likelihood based approach is proposed to make inference for the logistic model by incorporating the internal case-control data and external information. We show that the intercept parameter is identifiable with the help of external information, and then all the regression parameters as well as the marginal case proportion can be estimated consistently. The proposed method also accounts for the possible variability in external studies. The resultant estimators are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed. The asymptotic variance-covariance matrix can be consistently estimated by the case-control data. The optimal way to utilized external information is discussed. Simulation studies are conducted to verify the theoretical findings. A real data set is analyzed for illustration.</p>
