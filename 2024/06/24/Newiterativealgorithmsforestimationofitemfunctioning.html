<meta name="description" content="When the item functioning of multi-item measurement is modeled with three or four-parameter models, parameter estimation may become challenging. Effective algorithms are crucial in such scenarios. This paper explores innovations to parameter estimation in generalized logistic regression models, which may be used in item response modeling to account for guessing/pretending or slipping/dissimulation and for the effect of covariates. We introduce a new implementation of the EM algorithm and propose a new algorithm based on the parametrized link function. The two novel iterative algorithms are compared to existing methods in a simulation study. Additionally, the study examines software implementation, including the specification of initial values for numerical algorithms and asymptotic properties with an estimation of standard errors. Overall, the newly proposed algorithm based on the parametrized link function outperforms other procedures, especially for small sample sizes. Moreover, the newly implemented EM algorithm provides additional information regarding respondents’ inclination to guess or pretend and slip or dissimulate when answering the item. The study also discusses applications of the methods in the context of the detection of differential item functioning.

  <p>When the item functioning of multi-item measurement is modeled with three or four-parameter models, parameter estimation may become challenging. Effective algorithms are crucial in such scenarios. This paper explores innovations to parameter estimation in generalized logistic regression models, which may be used in item response modeling to account for guessing/pretending or slipping/dissimulation and for the effect of covariates. We introduce a new implementation of the EM algorithm and propose a new algorithm based on the parametrized link function. The two novel iterative algorithms are compared to existing methods in a simulation study. Additionally, the study examines software implementation, including the specification of initial values for numerical algorithms and asymptotic properties with an estimation of standard errors. Overall, the newly proposed algorithm based on the parametrized link function outperforms other procedures, especially for small sample sizes. Moreover, the newly implemented EM algorithm provides additional information regarding respondents’ inclination to guess or pretend and slip or dissimulate when answering the item. The study also discusses applications of the methods in the context of the detection of differential item functioning. Methods are demonstrated using real data from psychological and educational assessments.</p>
