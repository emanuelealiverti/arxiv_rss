<meta name="description" content="We propose a Bayesian method for deriving the distribution of restricted mean survival time (RMST) using posterior samples, which accounts for covariates and heterogeneity among clusters based on a parametric model for survival time. We derive an explicit RMST equation by devising an integral of the survival function, allowing for the calculation of not only the mean and credible interval but also the mode, median, and probability of exceeding a certain value. Additionally, We propose two methods: one using random effects to account for heterogeneity among clusters and another utilizing frailty. We developed custom Stan code for the exponential, Weibull, log-normal frailty, and log-logistic models, as they cannot be processed using the brm functions in R. We evaluate our proposed methods through computer simulations and analyze real data from the eight Empowered Action Group states in India to confirm consistent results across states after adjusting for cluster differences. In conclusion, we derived explicit RMST formulas for parametric models and their distributions, enabling the calculation of the mean, median, mode, and credible interval. Our simulations confirmed the robustness of the proposed methods, and using the shrinkage effect allowed for more accurate results for each cluster." />

  <h1>Bayesian Parametric Methods for Deriving Distribution of Restricted Mean Survival Time</h1>

  <p>We propose a Bayesian method for deriving the distribution of restricted mean survival time (RMST) using posterior samples, which accounts for covariates and heterogeneity among clusters based on a parametric model for survival time. We derive an explicit RMST equation by devising an integral of the survival function, allowing for the calculation of not only the mean and credible interval but also the mode, median, and probability of exceeding a certain value. Additionally, We propose two methods: one using random effects to account for heterogeneity among clusters and another utilizing frailty. We developed custom Stan code for the exponential, Weibull, log-normal frailty, and log-logistic models, as they cannot be processed using the brm functions in R. We evaluate our proposed methods through computer simulations and analyze real data from the eight Empowered Action Group states in India to confirm consistent results across states after adjusting for cluster differences. In conclusion, we derived explicit RMST formulas for parametric models and their distributions, enabling the calculation of the mean, median, mode, and credible interval. Our simulations confirmed the robustness of the proposed methods, and using the shrinkage effect allowed for more accurate results for each cluster.</p>
