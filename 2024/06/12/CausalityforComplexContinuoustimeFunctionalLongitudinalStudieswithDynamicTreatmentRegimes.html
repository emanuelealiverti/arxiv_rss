  <p>Causal inference in longitudinal studies is often hampered by treatment-confounder feedback. Existing methods typically assume discrete time steps or step-like data changes, which we term <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regular and irregular functional studies,'' limiting their applicability to studies with continuous monitoring data, like intensive care units or continuous glucose monitoring. These studies, which we formally term</code>functional longitudinal studies,’’ require new approaches. Moreover, existing methods tailored for ``functional longitudinal studies’’ can only investigate static treatment regimes, which are independent of historical covariates or treatments, leading to either stringent parametric assumptions or strong positivity assumptions. This restriction has limited the range of causal questions these methods can answer and their practicality. We address these limitations by developing a nonparametric framework for functional longitudinal data, accommodating dynamic treatment regimes that depend on historical covariates or treatments, and may or may not depend on the actual treatment administered. To build intuition and explain our approach, we provide a comprehensive review of existing methods for regular and irregular longitudinal studies. We then formally define the potential outcomes and causal effects of interest, develop identification assumptions, and derive g-computation and inverse probability weighting formulas through novel applications of stochastic process and measure theory. Additionally, we compute the efficient influence curve using semiparametric theory. Our framework generalizes existing literature, and achieves double robustness under specific conditions. Finally, to aid interpretation, we provide sufficient and intuitive conditions for our identification assumptions, enhancing the applicability of our methodology to real-world scenarios.</p>
