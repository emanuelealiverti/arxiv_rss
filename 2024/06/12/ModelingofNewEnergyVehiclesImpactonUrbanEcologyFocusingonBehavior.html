  <p>The surging demand for new energy vehicles is driven by the imperative to conserve energy, reduce emissions, and enhance the ecological ambiance. By conducting behavioral analysis and mining usage patterns of new energy vehicles, particular patterns can be identified. For instance, overloading the battery, operating with low battery power, and driving at excessive speeds can all detrimentally affect the battery’s performance. To assess the impact of such driving behavior on the urban ecology, an environmental computational modeling method has been proposed to simulate the interaction between new energy vehicles and the environment. To extend the time series data of the vehicle’s entire life cycle and the ecological environment within the model sequence data, the LSTM model with Bayesian optimizer is utilized for simulation.
