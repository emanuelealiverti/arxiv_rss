  <p>We describe how to calculate standard errors for A/B tests that include clustered data, ratio metrics, and/or covariate adjustment. We may do this for power analysis/sample size calculations prior to running an experiment using historical data, or after an experiment for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. The different applications have a common framework, using the sample variance of certain residuals. The framework is compatible with modular software, can be plugged into standard tools, doesn’t require computing covariance matrices, and is numerically stable. Using this approach we estimate that covariate adjustment gives a median 66% variance reduction for a key metric, reducing experiment run time by 66%.</p>
