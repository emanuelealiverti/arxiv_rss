<meta name="description" content="The rapid spread of West Nile Virus (WNV) is a growing concern. With no vaccines or specific medications available, prevention through mosquito control is the only solution to curb the spread. Mosquito traps, used to detect viral presence in mosquito populations, are essential tools for WNV surveillance. But how do we decide where to place a mosquito trap? And what makes a good trap location, anyway? We present a robust statistical approach to determine a mosquito trap’s ability to predict human WNV cases in the Chicago metropolitan area and its suburbs. We then use this value to detect the landscape, demographic, and socioeconomic factors associated with a mosquito trap’s predictive ability. This approach enables resource-limited mosquito control programs to identify better trap locations while reducing trap numbers to increase trap-based surveillance efficiency. The approach can also be applied to a wide range of different environmental surveillance programs." />

  <p>The rapid spread of West Nile Virus (WNV) is a growing concern. With no vaccines or specific medications available, prevention through mosquito control is the only solution to curb the spread. Mosquito traps, used to detect viral presence in mosquito populations, are essential tools for WNV surveillance. But how do we decide where to place a mosquito trap? And what makes a good trap location, anyway?
  We present a robust statistical approach to determine a mosquito trap’s ability to predict human WNV cases in the Chicago metropolitan area and its suburbs. We then use this value to detect the landscape, demographic, and socioeconomic factors associated with a mosquito trap’s predictive ability. This approach enables resource-limited mosquito control programs to identify better trap locations while reducing trap numbers to increase trap-based surveillance efficiency. The approach can also be applied to a wide range of different environmental surveillance programs.</p>
