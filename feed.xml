We propose a continuous relaxation of the objective function and show that inference and optimization can be computationally tractable. We consider in particular the optimization domain where very few observations and strict budgets exist; motivated by optimizing protein sequences for expensive to evaluate bio-chemical properties. The advantages of our approach are two-fold: the problem is treated in the continuous setting, and available prior knowledge over sequences can be incorporated directly. More specifically, we utilize available and learned distributions over the problem domain for a weighting of the Hellinger distance which yields a covariance function. We show that the resulting acquisition function can be optimized with both continuous or discrete optimization algorithms and empirically assess our method on two bio-chemical sequence optimization tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

This approach encompasses not only the visual aspects of lighting performance but also prioritizes the physiological and psychological well-being of library users. Incorporating a newly defined metric, Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE), the approach quantifies user-light interaction, enabling tailored lighting strategies that respond to diverse activities and needs in library spaces. Case studies demonstrate how the CIL matrix can be practically applied, offering significant improvements over conventional methods by focusing on optimized user experiences from both visual impacts and non-visual effects.&lt;/p&gt;

Mixture cure models are preferable when the existence of a cured fraction among patients can be assumed. However, such models are heavily underexplored: frailty structures within cure models remain largely undeveloped, and furthermore, most existing methods do not work for high-dimensional datasets, when the number of predictors is significantly larger than the number of observations. In this study, we introduce a novel extension of the Weibull mixture cure model that incorporates a frailty component, employed to model an underlying latent population heterogeneity with respect to the outcome risk. Additionally, high-dimensional covariates are integrated into both the cure rate and survival part of the model, providing a comprehensive approach to employ the model in the context of high-dimensional omics data. We also perform variable selection via an adaptive elastic-net penalization, and propose a novel approach to inference using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Extensive simulation studies are conducted across various scenarios to demonstrate the performance of the model, and results indicate that our proposed method outperforms competitor models. We apply the novel approach to analyze RNAseq gene expression data from bulk breast cancer patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A set of prognostic biomarkers is then derived from selected genes, and subsequently validated via both functional enrichment analysis and comparison to the existing biological literature. Finally, a prognostic risk score index based on the identified biomarkers is proposed and validated by exploring the patients‚Äô survival.&lt;/p&gt;
