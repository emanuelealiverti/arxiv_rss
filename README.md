# Stat RSS

I read arxiv every day, and sometimes I want to read on a cleaner page.
Also, I wanted to learn Github actions in practice

- The branch `main` contains the infrastracture for updating the page and building the website via jekyll; the branch `gh-pages` the depolyed website.

The website is rendered at [https://emanuelealiverti.github.io/arxiv_rss/](https://emanuelealiverti.github.io/arxiv_rss/) and updated every day at 9 via Github Actions.
